Bed016.C.dialogueact311	754.37	757.02	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and um and he was going to send me some slides but he didn't do 
Bed016.C.dialogueact312	757.02	758.23	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but he didn't do it so 
Bed016.C.dialogueact313	758.82	761.26	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it so from that i have the paper i can 
Bed016.C.dialogueact314	761.26	764.44	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i can like a resume of that and then 
Bed016.C.dialogueact315	764.44	768.81	C	Grad	s	-1	0	of that and then i still excuse so um one of your talks i think 
Bed016.A.dialogueact316	768.95	769.26	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that's talks i think 
Bed016.A.dialogueact317	769.91	771.13	A	Grad	s:qw^rt	-1	0	that's a great to get that okay yeah it looks familiar 
Bed016.A.dialogueact319	771.28	771.62	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay yeah it looks familiar 
Bed016.F.dialogueact318	771.083	772.123	F	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	okay familiar yeah it looks familiar 
Bed016.A.dialogueact320	772.42	773.34	A	Grad	s	-1	0	familiar 
Bed016.C.dialogueact321	774.45	777.73	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i think that's bergen chang um something the other 
Bed016.A.dialogueact322	777.15	777.18	A	Grad	b	-1	0	the other 
Bed016.E.dialogueact323	777.275	777.605	E	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	the other 
Bed016.A.dialogueact324	779.27	779.86	A	Grad	b	-1	0	um 
Bed016.C.dialogueact325	779.282	781.132	C	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um and that's not enough to 
Bed016.C.dialogueact326	781.432	782.462	C	Grad	s	-1	0	not enough to bring that so that's 
Bed016.C.dialogueact327	782.462	785.762	C	Grad	s	-1	0	bring that so that's basically what i that's so far and the rest 
Bed016.C.dialogueact328	785.762	787.282	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so far and the rest is four airplanes 
Bed016.C.dialogueact329	788.561	790.231	C	Grad	s.%--	+1	2	so it's given us then i would like to do talk about the construction 
Bed016.C.dialogueact330	790.231	793.641	C	Grad	s	+1	0	do talk about the construction mm aspects and then 
Bed016.C.dialogueact331	793.641	795.691	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and then at the end uh bought a basement 
Bed016.A.dialogueact332	796.457	796.887	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed016.C.dialogueact333	797.97	799.69	C	Grad	s^tc	-1	0	end of story 
Bed016.C.dialogueact334	806.44	808.88	C	Grad	qo^rt	-1	0	anything i forgot that we should mention 
Bed016.C.dialogueact335	812.057	813.857	C	Grad	s	+1	1	may be the f. m. r. i. stuff so 
Bed016.C.dialogueact336	813.857	821.677	C	Grad	qy	-1	0	r. i. stuff so i mentioned the fact that um well it's actually started going to start to look at people's brains and a more direct way it certainly 
Bed016.E.dialogueact337	821.84	822.59	E	Professor	s	-1	0	way it certainly can i mean i 
Bed016.E.dialogueact338	822.8	824.28	E	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	might just want to like tacked can i mean i i you know i don't know 
Bed016.A.dialogueact339	823.95	827.6	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	might just want to like tacked on the common i you know i don't know right um 
Bed016.E.dialogueact340	826.56	826.93	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right 
Bed016.E.dialogueact341	827.12	827.84	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	um 
Bed016.C.dialogueact342	828.8	830.61	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	attracted to tease something well 
Bed016.E.dialogueact343	830.54	835.06	E	Professor	s	+1	1	well the time dimension if you mention it is when you talk about mirrored runs then 
Bed016.E.dialogueact344	835.898	842.628	E	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah then you should talk about the more recent stuff about the ticking and you know 
Bed016.C.dialogueact346	842.89	843.12	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah ticking and you know yeah and 
Bed016.E.dialogueact345	842.628	843.088	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah ticking and you know yeah and 
Bed016.E.dialogueact347	843.218	843.498	E	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah and 
Bed016.E.dialogueact348	843.738	852.753	E	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah and plan is to see to what extent but the same phenomena with stories about 
Bed016.E.dialogueact349	852.753	853.063	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	and they were planning 
Bed016.C.dialogueact350	853.46	853.75	C	Grad	b	-1	0	and they were planning 
Bed016.E.dialogueact351	853.525	854.925	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and they were planning to do this

Bed016.E.dialogueact356	863.43	870.404	E	Professor	s	+1	0	depends i mean there is a um whole language learning store 
Bed016.E.dialogueact357	871.719	872.079	E	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	which

Bed016.A.dialogueact505	1148.09	1148.33	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	anyway so oh and the presentation 
Bed016.C.dialogueact506	1148.21	1149.33	C	Grad	s	-1	0	anyway so it's not oh and the presentation i 
Bed016.A.dialogueact507	1149.14	1150.19	A	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	it's not i said actually worried

Bed016.C.dialogueact509	1149.95	1152.12	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it's not i said actually worried about take yeah 
Bed016.C.dialogueact510	1152.33	1154.42	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	yeah no that's quite possible 
Bed016.C.dialogueact511	1155.14	1157.68	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	it's copy and paste from 
Bed016.E.dialogueact512	1161.09	1161.54	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so i did not it 
Bed016.E.dialogueact513	1161.54	1165.21	E	Professor	s	+1	1	so i did not it looks like the uh metaphor didn't get in yet 
Bed016.C.dialogueact514	1166.48	1167.28	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	had it that there is a reference

Bed016.E.dialogueact516	1169.28	1170.62	E	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	well reference is one thing the question 
Bed016.E.dialogueact517	1170.62	1172.33	E	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	is one thing the question is is there any place oh did 
Bed016.E.dialogueact518	1172.81	1174.38	E	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	oh did you put in something about 
Bed016.A.dialogueact519	1175.14	1176.14	A	Grad	s^2^bu	-1	0	the time of the four and uh

Bed016.E.dialogueact524	1186.19	1187.06	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh yeah okay 
Bed016.E.dialogueact525	1189.51	1191.15	E	Professor	s^ba|s	-1	0	i see you 
Bed016.E.dialogueact526	1195.53	1198.37	E	Professor	s	+1	0	so the top of the second to page two unison 
Bed016.C.dialogueact527	1197.47	1198.23	C	Grad	b	-1	0	page two unison 
Bed016.E.dialogueact528	1199.54	1212.76	E	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	what i meant is i think even before you give this to boston there uh you should 
Bed016.E.dialogueact529	1217.48	1218.29	E	Professor	s	-1	0	unless you put in text i don't think it's very 
Bed016.E.dialogueact530	1218.29	1219.35	E	Professor	s	-1	0	text i don't think it's very good about we 
Bed016.E.dialogueact531	1219.41	1231.35	E	Professor	s	-1	0	good about we talked about is and um skill ability that you get combining and instructions with the general construe mechanism 
Bed016.E.dialogueact532	1231.7	1232.12	E	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	yeah um 
Bed016.C.dialogueact533	1232.56	1232.96	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah um 
Bed016.C.dialogueact534	1232.96	1234.38	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah um um okay so where where is it 
Bed016.E.dialogueact535	1233.68	1234.98	E	Professor	s^bk|qw	-1	0	um okay so where where is it 
Bed016.E.dialogueact536	1234.98	1235.84	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	um so where where is it 
Bed016.C.dialogueact537	1235.54	1238.89	C	Grad	h|s	-1	0	um but i did not focus on that aspect 
Bed016.C.dialogueact538	1239.08	1243.0	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	but um 
Bed016.C.dialogueact539	1244.86	1250.51	C	Grad	s	-1	0	um that's just underneath uh that's referenced to metaphor since last

Bed016.E.dialogueact550	1269.57	1272.74	E	Professor	s	+1	0	no i it it's said that but it doesn't 
Bed016.E.dialogueact551	1272.74	1274.82	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	said that but it doesn't say it doesn't it it got doesn't 
Bed016.C.dialogueact552	1274.03	1274.37	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	it it got doesn't 
Bed016.E.dialogueact553	1274.82	1275.97	E	Professor	s^aa|s^e	+1	0	it it got doesn't give the punch 
Bed016.C.dialogueact554	1276.22	1276.64	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed016.E.dialogueact555	1277.56	1280.68	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	is it because of the gang what i think the punch line is 
Bed016.E.dialogueact556	1281.01	1283.04	E	Professor	s	-1	0	because it's actually important which is is 
Bed016.E.dialogueact557	1283.72	1298.86	E	Professor	s^ba	+1	0	which is is that e. constructions that uh um seems keys and friends are doing uh are you know wait wait 
Bed016.E.dialogueact558	1302.54	1307.48	E	Professor	s	+1	2	cover only base case 
Bed016.E.dialogueact559	1308.15	1319.53	E	Professor	s	+1	2	and to make them a long i soon metaphor vocations and then make cases and all those things requires this additional mechanism uh school 
Bed016.E.dialogueact560	1320.15	1330.11	E	Professor	s	+1	0	and the punch line is that if you do this right you can get essentially or plug anality that do 
Bed016.E.dialogueact561	1330.11	1339.08	E	Professor	s	+1	0	that do reducing in construction at at the base level it should some uh interact with all believe the economy's in metaphor so that all of objections 
Bed016.E.dialogueact562	1339.08	1342.41	E	Professor	s	+1	0	that all of objections of it also should work 
Bed016.F.dialogueact563	1339.21	1339.91	F	Grad	b	-1	0	that all of objections 
Bed016.E.dialogueact564	1343.99	1353.35	E	Professor	s	+1	0	and similarly if you introduce a new metaphor it should be and uh composed with all the construction 
Bed016.F.dialogueact565	1347.86	1348.25	F	Grad	b	-1	0	it should be and 
Bed016.F.dialogueact566	1353.67	1353.88	F	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed016.E.dialogueact567	1356.02	1360.81	E	Professor	s	-1	0	to the extent that's true then then it's a big win over anything that exists 
Bed016.D.dialogueact568	1375.35	1385.1	D	Grad	qy^bu	-1	0	because i mean is it's i think that sometimes the rules and they're actually grammar you just have these these contracts and then the general mechanism for coercing him

Bed016.E.dialogueact571	1391.68	1399.21	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so that you know for example uh in the metaphor tasted you have kind of direct idea of the source passing goal 
Bed016.E.dialogueact572	1400.17	1407.19	E	Professor	s	-1	0	any metaphor for one abstract and all that stuff and do the same grammar it is 
Bed016.D.dialogueact574	1407.78	1408.26	D	Grad	b	-1	0	it is the same 
Bed016.E.dialogueact573	1407.77	1408.76	E	Professor	s	-1	0	it is the same 
Bed016.E.dialogueact575	1409.5	1411.29	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	by the trick 
Bed016.E.dialogueact576	1411.64	1413.4	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the trick is that 
Bed016.E.dialogueact577	1414.76	1420.54	E	Professor	s	-1	0	the way to constructions written it requires that the topic to the present position for example be container 
Bed016.E.dialogueact578	1421.23	1422.69	E	Professor	s	-1	0	well trouble listen to container and 
Bed016.E.dialogueact579	1422.91	1424.84	E	Professor	s	-1	0	to container and gets just construed as contained 
Bed016.D.dialogueact580	1425.19	1425.44	D	Grad	b	-1	0	et cetera 
Bed016.E.dialogueact581	1425.83	1426.13	E	Professor	s	-1	0	et cetera so that's 
Bed016.E.dialogueact582	1426.4	1429.87	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so that's that's where this 
Bed016.D.dialogueact583	1430.03	1433.27	D	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so with cancer you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing can until the rule

Bed016.C.dialogueact754	1802.31	1806.16	C	Grad	s	+1	2	we have to we have to initiative would start discussing or the out of film right

Bed016.C.dialogueact756	1807.04	1808.76	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and there's a lot of hard audience analysis so

Bed016.C.dialogueact759	1813.21	1814.2	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	because we kept that's the different

Bed016.A.dialogueact761	1817.6	1819.09	A	Grad	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	yeah it's a little it's uh we thought about before 
Bed016.A.dialogueact762	1819.09	1822.4	A	Grad	s	+1	0	uh we thought about before it it it's use examples and other papers and it's 
Bed016.A.dialogueact763	1822.4	1824.83	A	Grad	s^ba^ng	+1	0	papers and it's it's a little complicated 
Bed016.A.dialogueact765	1825.29	1828.09	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because you like it's a state of there's resource right and like would of outer film in particular

Bed016.A.dialogueact769	1830.97	1839.83	A	Grad	s	-1	0	what is filmed the state you know you're out of the state of having fell right and somehow films is standing for that the reason for the state of having the resources just label is that resource 
Bed016.F.dialogueact770	1840.21	1840.57	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	it's yeah i

Bed016.A.dialogueact775	1841.87	1842.6	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	it's a little bit mean but and plus the fact that there's also 
Bed016.F.dialogueact773	1841.38	1841.66	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	it's a mean but and

Bed016.F.dialogueact786	1859.09	1859.83	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed016.F.dialogueact787	1861.71	1863.21	F	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i never really knew what was going on i mean i i find in 
Bed016.F.dialogueact788	1863.21	1870.12	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	on i mean i i find in sort of a little bit far fetched to say that that i'm out of film means i have left the state of having a film or something like that but 
Bed016.A.dialogueact789	1866.56	1867.07	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that i'm out of film means i have left 
Bed016.A.dialogueact790	1870.15	1870.34	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	but 
Bed016.F.dialogueact791	1870.21	1870.51	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	but 
Bed016.A.dialogueact793	1871.75	1875.24	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	or having is also um so there was location right so 
Bed016.E.dialogueact792	1871.69	1872.25	E	Professor	b	-1	0	or having is also 
Bed016.A.dialogueact795	1875.56	1875.87	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right so 
Bed016.F.dialogueact794	1875.28	1876.62	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right so if the 
Bed016.A.dialogueact796	1875.87	1877.63	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	right so if the film last you know 
Bed016.A.dialogueact797	1877.63	1879.7	A	Grad	s	-1	0	film last you know state is being near film so running running out of something 
Bed016.C.dialogueact798	1878.22	1881.87	C	Grad	s	-1	0	state is being near film so running running out of something is different from being archive somewhere 
Bed016.E.dialogueact799	1883.1	1884.79	E	Professor	s^2^aap	-1	0	being out of something as well 
Bed016.E.dialogueact800	1886.03	1888.61	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but that's running out of it definitely has a process aspect 
Bed016.A.dialogueact801	1888.34	1888.64	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	but that's 
Bed016.A.dialogueact802	1888.83	1889.9	A	Grad	s^aap|s^aa	-1	0	but that's a run yeah 
Bed016.E.dialogueact804	1888.98	1889.2	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	but that's a run yeah 
Bed016.F.dialogueact803	1888.94	1889.31	F	Grad	b	-1	0	but that's a run yeah 
Bed016.E.dialogueact805	1890.38	1891.01	E	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	that's okay i mean but but 
Bed016.A.dialogueact807	1891.24	1891.41	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	mean but but 
Bed016.E.dialogueact806	1891.01	1892.58	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	mean but but the difference 
Bed016.C.dialogueact808	1893.07	1895.86	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so define instead of running out of something is being out of it is 
Bed016.E.dialogueact809	1893.13	1893.54	E	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	so define instead is 
Bed016.A.dialogueact812	1896.4	1897.27	A	Grad	s^aa|%--	-1	0	yeah so that part is you got there 
Bed016.E.dialogueact811	1895.98	1896.21	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah so is being out of it you got 
Bed016.F.dialogueact810	1895.93	1896.17	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah so is being out of it you got 
Bed016.F.dialogueact813	1896.81	1897.33	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah so that part is you got there 
Bed016.A.dialogueact814	1897.55	1898.35	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that part is fine there you've got to out 
Bed016.F.dialogueact815	1898.49	1899.37	F	Grad	s	-1	0	fine you've got to out of it and
