The Berkeley Robustness group discussed various projects by students and research staff.
First speaker fn002 presented her experimental results on voice unvoice detection.
Speaker me006 talked about his work on testing completeness for acoustic events and his plans for using support vector machines to recognise phonological features.
Speakers me013 and me018 discussed improvements to the current implementation of the RASTA feature representation.
Finally speaker me026 presented his experiment with the mean subtraction method and the group discussed its implications.
Speaker fn002 will work on a project for France Telecom.
Speaker me006 will conduct a preliminary experiment to see if the features he plans to use are sufficient.
He will also compare the performance of support vector machines to that of recurrent neural nets on a classification task.
Speaker me018 will re run his experiment on a smaller dataset for the purpose of troubleshooting.
Speaker me013 argues that additional features used by speaker fn002 are not optimal and suggests an alternative approach.
The results of speaker fn002s experiment are worse than expected probably due to additive noise.
Speaker fn002 needs clarification regarding the details of the forthcoming France Telecom project.
Will support vector machines perform as well as recurrent neural nets with less data.
How can probabilities be estimated from the binary output of a SVM classifier.
Speaker me018 suspects a bug in his speech recognition software as the performance difference between the PLP and Mel cepstrum feature representations seems too large.
Can the mean subtraction method perform as well with an industry standard speech recogniser.
Speaker fn002 has conducted experiments with new features to detect voice unvoice.
Speaker me006 has assembled most of his quals committee.
Speaker me026 has greatly improved performance of HTK speech recogniser by applying the mean subtraction method.
