In the first part of the Berkeley Meeting Recorder group meeting members discuss a potential collaboration with an external researcher on inference structures in dialogue.
In the second part speaker mn005 presents his work on detecting overlap of acoustic events the implications of which are discussed by the group.
Finally the members discuss the current data status and plans for further data collection as well as techniques to improve speech recognition such as speaker adaptation and echo cancellation.
Acoustic information such as prosody and voice directionality should be used to supplement lexical information.
In order to save time only speaker overlaps should be marked in the future.
There are plans to collect further meeting data both from internal and external sources and the aim is to collect over a hundred hours worth of speech.
It is much more difficult to infer information from face to face meetings than from narrative.
Frequent use of pronouns also adds difficulty.
Identifying individuals in publications might lead to slander charges.
There are discrepancies between speech signals recorded on individual microphones and the PZM.
Detecting overlap of all acoustic events is very time consuming.
Three hundred overlapping acoustic events have been found in forty five minutes of speech.
Speaker me011 has written a bootstrapping program.
About twelve hours of meetings have already been recorded.
