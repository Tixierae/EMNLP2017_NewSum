The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape. The team felt it was not necessary to include a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost as the prototype designs were quite bright. The team conducted a product evaluation of the prototype the team liked the most. They rated the prototype on the basis of its appearance , functionality , technological innovativeness , sponginess , usability , learn-ability , its ability to be found when misplaced , simplicity , and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. The project manager then led the team in a project evaluation in which the team evaluated how they created the project , the information they found and used , their creativity , their teamwork , and the materials they had at their disposal. The team was generally quite satisfied. After the project manager's closing , the team discussed their personal preferences in terms of the prototypes. They also further evaluated the project process and discussed what they had learned. *NA* The remote will resemble the potato prototype.
