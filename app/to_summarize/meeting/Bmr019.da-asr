Bmr019.B.dialogueact141	213.684	214.344	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the same thing and and it was uh 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact142	214.907	230.407	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	0	it was uh i mean there's a point of interest of the group was primarily that um the uh the system that we had that was based on each take a it's used by you know all the participants in aurora was so much worse than the than the sri and the interesting everybody 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact143	225.089	225.589	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	all the participants everybody 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact144	230.407	247.411	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and the interesting thing is that even though yes it's a digits tasking that's relatively small number of words and there's a bunch of digits that you train and it's just not as good as having uh very large amount of data and training up uh a nice good big each minimum also you had

Bmr019.B.dialogueact146	251.62	254.4	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um so we know 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact147	254.239	254.939	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	we know 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact148	255.354	257.894	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	did did they send you some results without attention

Bmr019.B.dialogueact153	262.193	262.593	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so yeah i 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact154	262.85	264.07	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so yeah i think i did actually so there 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact155	264.75	268.3	F	PhD	s	+1	1	so there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation

Bmr019.F.dialogueact160	273.185	274.935	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	well i don't know overall 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact161	276.172	277.242	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	uh i don't remember but there was 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact162	277.242	284.516	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but there was there was a significant lot when from adaptation with with a passion

Bmr019.F.dialogueact164	288.2	289.56	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that was the phone about a patient and then there was 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact165	289.56	300.435	F	PhD	s	-1	0	a patient and then there was a very small like point one percent on the natives uh wind from doing adaptation to the recognition i probably 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact166	301.306	305.046	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i tried both means adaptation and means and very insistent the variance instead of 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact167	305.046	308.316	F	PhD	s	-1	0	the variance instead of another or subtraction another point one percent so 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact168	308.316	311.32	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so that's the number that point six i believe 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact169	311.36	316.952	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that point six i believe is what you get for i mean sometimes it's 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact170	312.005	312.285	E	Grad	b	-1	0	is what you get for 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact171	317.632	320.612	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but i think one thing is that uh i would presume have have 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact172	320.712	326.019	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	have have you ever have you ever tried this exact same recognize around on the actual t. i. digits testing 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact173	328.95	330.16	F	PhD	qw^br	-1	0	it this exact same mechanism 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact174	330.16	330.41	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	it 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact175	331.008	332.208	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	might be interesting do that might my my because 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact176	332.208	333.928	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	might my my because my sense 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact177	334.574	334.934	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um but but 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact178	334.802	340.002	F	PhD	s	-1	0	um that it would do even slightly better but but i have i mean people people at sri are actually working on digits i could 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact179	335.98	337.46	E	Grad	s	-1	0	that it would do even slightly better i have i mean people people at sri are 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact180	340.452	346.63	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i could and they're using a system that you know is actually trained on you 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact181	347.2	355.32	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but otherwise use the same you know decoder the same uh training benefits and so forth and i could 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact182	350.316	350.656	B	Professor	b	-1	0	you know decoder 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact183	355.32	358.25	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	yeah but i do think be interesting to and i could ask them what they get into this 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact184	357.375	361.105	B	Professor	s^bk|s^cs^ng	+1	1	yeah but i do think be interesting to just take this exact actual system so these numbers were comparable into this 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact185	361.105	362.475	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so these numbers were comparable and try it out and well 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact186	361.438	362.238	F	PhD	b	-1	0	so these numbers were comparable and try it out and well 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact188	362.475	363.785	B	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	1	and try it out and see i just well i don't how to run it 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact187	362.278	364.148	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and try it out and see i just yeah yeah yeah no problem well i don't how to run it so you just 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact191	364.39	364.63	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah yeah yeah no problem so you just 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact189	364.127	365.067	E	Grad	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	yeah yeah yeah yeah no problem so you just making 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact190	364.278	366.841	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah yeah yeah because our sense yeah no problem that's right yeah so you just making 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact192	365.01	365.25	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah making 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact193	365.47	365.71	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah making 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact194	366.04	369.61	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	because our sense from the other from they were to ask is that i mean because that's right yeah it just 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact195	366.53	367.62	E	Grad	s	-1	0	because our sense from the other from that's right yeah it just 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact196	368.596	369.366	F	PhD	b	-1	0	they were to ask is that i mean because 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact197	369.61	375.28	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	is that i mean because we're getting some blunt percent numbers on t. i. digits also was attending thing so one 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact198	372.251	373.071	F	PhD	b	-1	0	numbers on t. i. digits also 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact200	375.28	377.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	thing so one so there were a number of things you know to from this one 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact199	374.993	375.703	F	PhD	b	-1	0	was attending thing so one 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact201	377.87	380.66	B	Professor	s	+1	0	things you know to from this one is yeah that's right system is a lot better than these t. k. 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact202	380.527	380.797	F	PhD	b	-1	0	t. k. 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact203	381.389	383.979	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this year very limited training is teaching system 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact204	383.319	383.959	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	is teaching system 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact205	384.422	395.563	B	Professor	s	+1	3	uh but the other is that um the digits recorded here in this room with these close bikes uh actually a lot harder than the studio recording digits i 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact207	395.973	402.743	B	Professor	s	-1	0	digits i you know one reason for that uh might be that the so even though it's close talking there's still has some noise and summer in acoustics 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact206	395.923	396.663	F	PhD	b	-1	0	digits i you know one reason for 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact208	401.525	402.305	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and summer in acoustics 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact209	403.109	410.099	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and other might be that's uh i i would presume that in the studio uh uh situation of recording read speech that if somebody did something 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact210	410.655	415.765	B	Professor	s	-1	0	did something a little funny and it's not something little funny or made a little that they didn't include it to me and 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact211	413.948	414.668	E	Grad	qy^2^bu^d^rt	-1	0	or made a little that they 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact212	415.765	416.865	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	didn't include it to me and do it again whereas i took 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact213	416.27	421.09	E	Grad	s	-1	0	do it again whereas i took out the ones that i noticed that were blatant that were corrected so 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact214	420.444	420.624	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	that were corrected 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact215	421.572	422.332	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so that if someone just 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact216	422.011	424.611	E	Grad	s	-1	0	that if someone just read the wrong digit i corrected it and then 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact218	424.79	425.35	B	Professor	b	-1	0	it and then there was another one where 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact217	424.611	430.43	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	it and then there was another one where jose couldn't tell whether i couldn't tell whether we sing zero or six and i asked him 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact219	430.49	432.14	E	Grad	s	-1	0	six and i asked him and he couldn't tell either so 
Bmr019.I.dialogueact220	431.939	432.129	I	Grad	b	-1	0	and he couldn't tell either so 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact221	432.905	433.835	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so i just cut it out 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact223	434.853	435.163	B	Professor	b	-1	0	you know so i just it 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact222	434.686	438.856	E	Grad	s	-1	0	you know so i just it out the first uh word of the hotter it's um 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact224	438.916	442.516	E	Grad	s	-1	0	hotter it's um so there's a little bit of corrections it's definitely not as clean c. i. digits to my 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact225	442.899	445.429	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i. digits to my expectations is t. i. digit would especially 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact226	446.42	448.91	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	i think yeah it is all american english right 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact229	449.391	449.771	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	so it probably 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact227	448.91	449.18	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	english right so it probably 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact228	449.18	451.28	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so it probably do even a little better still 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact230	452.68	453.39	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	on his system but we could give it a try 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact231	453.39	454.23	E	Grad	s^bd^cs	-1	0	system but we could give it a try 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact232	453.678	453.968	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	system but we could give it a try 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact233	454.458	461.558	F	PhD	s	+1	0	room that breathing a telephone man with friends to and that's right so 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact234	461.558	465.72	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so i was i thought that maybe that's actually a good thing because 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact235	465.72	468.56	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	a good thing because it gets into some of the uh the noises 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact236	469.42	477.308	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	the low and about uh speech bandwidth and 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact237	472.327	472.767	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and about uh

Bmr019.F.dialogueact240	479.25	489.66	F	PhD	s	+1	1	i suspect that to get to the the last bit odd of these higher quality recordings you would have to in fact use models better were trained on whiter band data and 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact241	489.76	491.41	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	what data and of course you can't do that or

Bmr019.E.dialogueact289	570.053	572.613	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i strongly suspect that they have more speakers and we do 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact291	573.713	574.693	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so uh right but that's not being modest because 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact290	573.47	575.12	F	PhD	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	so uh right but that's not being modest because the numbers seem outdated 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact292	575.12	576.93	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	right the numbers seem outdated percy or 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact293	576.926	581.026	E	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	right so we we could probably do an extraction that it was roughly equivalent um percy or 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact294	578.19	578.37	F	PhD	b	-1	0	could probably do an extraction

Bmr019.F.dialogueact301	588.74	593.46	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and there that i'll have to take out right i saw so the the system actually extracts the speaker id from the way farm names and 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact302	593.679	594.399	E	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	right i saw that names and there's a there's

Bmr019.F.dialogueact307	607.467	619.074	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	right right and that id so we might have to modify that script to recognize the because

Bmr019.B.dialogueact325	655.928	658.368	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah most to see it it just is connected digits and i think they i mean we had a digits

Bmr019.B.dialogueact327	658.368	660.778	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think they i mean we had a bellcore corpus that we're using it was isabel

Bmr019.B.dialogueact461	879.257	880.157	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	well yeah i noticed that oh what of what what factors to

Bmr019.B.dialogueact463	880.976	881.656	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh no that was that factors to 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact462	880.951	881.311	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	oh no that was that factors to 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact464	881.656	885.686	B	Professor	s	-1	0	no that was that that they were saying you know well is how much worse as far as in there you know and meet 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact465	884.52	885.44	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	worse as far as in there you know and meet 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact466	885.686	887.556	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know and meet depends a much when you're looking at but for the 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact467	885.75	886.51	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you know and meet depends a much when 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact469	887.556	890.307	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	you're looking at but for the everybody's little under a factor too yeah 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact468	887.5	887.94	F	PhD	b	-1	0	you're looking at but for the 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact470	890.822	903.549	B	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	too yeah i and i was thinking was that maybe uh we could actually try at least looking at uh some of the the every very speech from afar microphone at least from the 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact471	903.549	904.509	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	microphone at least from the good one 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact472	903.682	904.472	F	PhD	b	-1	0	microphone at least from the good one 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact473	905.159	908.539	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean for us so we get you know a i'm fifty percent error or something but if 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact475	908.539	914.602	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	actually if you run or something but if if uh if we're getting thirty five forty percent or something 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact474	908.197	909.517	F	PhD	b	-1	0	or something but if if uh 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact476	914.0	922.659	A	PhD	s	-1	0	if you run though on a close talking mike over the whole meeting during all the silences you get like four hundred percent order right 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact477	920.604	921.064	B	Professor	b	-1	0	you get like four hundred percent 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact478	922.731	923.711	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	order right i understand they're doing 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact479	923.711	925.521	B	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	or or some i understand they're doing the same kind of limited thing 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact480	925.159	926.599	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	or or some high number thing yeah sure 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact481	926.676	927.196	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	high number yeah sure could always assertions 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact482	927.526	928.346	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	could always assertions but i'm saying if you do 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact483	928.346	934.941	B	Professor	s^cs^df.%-	+1	1	where you know who the but i'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing as people dying switchboard evaluations or is 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact484	929.25	929.51	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the same kind of limited thing 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact485	934.303	936.743	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	where you know who the speakers and there's no overlap 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact487	937.18	939.19	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^e^rt	-1	0	and you do just the first parcels of those regions 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact486	936.981	937.381	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	overlap and you do just the first parcels 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact488	940.086	942.116	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah the same sort of numbers that we got this restaurant right we do exactly the same thing that 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact490	942.116	942.406	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right exactly the same thing that 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact489	941.69	945.27	E	Grad	s^bu	+1	1	we got this restaurant right yeah i do a lot we do exactly the same thing that we're doing now but do the far afield mike because we 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact491	945.427	946.407	B	Professor	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	yeah i do a lot more because we extracted times from 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact492	945.74	947.86	E	Grad	s^df	+1	0	yeah i do a lot more because we extracted times from the near field might be easy 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact493	947.86	949.81	E	Grad	s	+1	1	right i the near field might be easy acoustics from the far field like 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact494	949.533	950.693	A	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	right i understand i just far field like 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact495	950.693	953.603	A	PhD	s	-1	0	understand i just meant that you have three choices there's 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact496	953.603	964.967	A	PhD	s	-1	0	choices there's um you can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segment patience for were synchronized 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact497	965.437	973.189	A	PhD	s	-1	0	raking do a forced alignment on the clothes talking to determine that these you know with in this segment these really where the times that this person was talking and elsewhere in the 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact498	973.189	975.419	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping and just one of those 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact499	975.419	976.749	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and just one of those pieces 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact500	977.578	979.078	A	PhD	s	-1	0	or you can um the whole day which is 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact501	979.078	981.227	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	which is which is you know but but but how did we get that how 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact502	980.272	989.04	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	which is you know in the h. o. t. but but but how did we get that how did we determine the links uh that were testing on in the stuff we reported 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact503	989.34	994.01	A	PhD	s	+1	1	in the h. o. t. pay for we took segments that are channel time aligned which is now had 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact504	994.15	997.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	which is now had being changed in the transcription process which is good 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact505	997.09	997.78	A	PhD	s	-1	0	which is good 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact506	998.296	1003.19	A	PhD	s:s	+1	1	and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here because no one else 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact507	1003.23	1007.37	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because no one else had time any words in that segment they called that non 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact508	1007.37	1008.77	A	PhD	s:s	+1	1	they called that non overlap and that's 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact509	1007.42	1007.73	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	they called that non 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact510	1008.77	1011.27	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	overlap yes the good and that's what we're getting those numbers right 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact511	1010.38	1010.67	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yes numbers 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact513	1011.72	1013.19	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	the good the good numbers the bad numbers right 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact512	1011.63	1011.93	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	the good right 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact514	1013.27	1017.04	A	PhD	s	+1	1	the bad numbers were from the segments where there was overlap yeah well we could start with the good ones but anyway 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact515	1016.31	1017.6	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	overlap yeah well we could start with the good ones but anyway 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact517	1017.99	1018.38	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah the good ones but anyway so i think we should try 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact516	1017.6	1023.08	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	yeah the good ones but anyway so i think we should try once with the same conditions that we use to create those and in those same 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact518	1023.08	1026.25	B	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	0	right so we we can do that and in those same segments just use one of the museums 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact519	1025.77	1027.28	A	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	right so we we can do that yeah one of the museums and then you know 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact521	1027.34	1027.57	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah and then you know 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact520	1027.29	1033.89	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah and then you know i mean the thing is if we're getting what thirty five forty percent something like that on on that particular set 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact522	1034.7	1036.96	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	uh does it go to seventy or eighty or 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact524	1037.43	1037.77	A	PhD	b	-1	0	use it 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact523	1036.96	1039.39	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	it might or eighty or use it so much memory can't decode it 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact525	1039.88	1044.22	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	it might also depend on which speaker that it is and how close they are to the peezie um i don't know how different it you want 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact526	1040.07	1040.7	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	also depend on which 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact527	1044.22	1046.16	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i don't know how different they are from each other to be you want to probably choose the t. v. and challenges 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact528	1044.82	1048.52	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	i don't know how different they are from each other to be best for this particular you want to probably choose the t. v. and challenges closest to the speaker 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact529	1046.86	1047.74	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	to be best t. v. and challenges closest to the

Bmr019.E.dialogueact530	1048.22	1051.21	E	Grad	s	-1	0	okay so for this particular digit ones i just picked that one speaker 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact532	1048.83	1049.07	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	for this particular digit ones i speaker 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact533	1049.41	1049.83	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	digit ones i 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact534	1051.41	1051.78	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact536	1051.78	1053.79	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	okay so we would then use that one too this is kind of central 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact537	1051.88	1052.18	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	okay so we would then use that this 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact535	1051.7	1052.42	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay so we would then use that this 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact538	1052.92	1054.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we would then use that one too this is kind of central you know it's so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact539	1053.79	1053.82	A	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	one too is kind of central 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact540	1054.32	1056.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know it's so is but i would i take that one it'll be less good 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact541	1056.28	1058.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	one it'll be less good for some people than for other but i like to see actually 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact542	1058.17	1062.82	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	other but i like to see it on the same exact same data set that that we did the other thing right actually i she actually should have picked a different one 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact543	1058.85	1059.25	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	other but i like to see it on the same exact actually 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact544	1061.44	1063.04	E	Grad	s	+1	0	that we did the other thing right i she actually should have picked a different one because that could 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact545	1062.82	1062.97	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	the other thing right have picked a different one 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact546	1063.04	1065.8	E	Grad	s^df	+1	0	because that could be why the p. a. is worse 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact547	1066.65	1069.24	E	Grad	s^df	+1	1	because this further away from most of the people reading digits 
Bmr019.D.dialogueact548	1067.24	1068.2	D	PhD	s^2^na|s^aa	-1	0	further away from most of the people reading digits 
Bmr019.D.dialogueact549	1069.9	1070.1	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that's probably one 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact550	1070.54	1071.65	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	that's probably one of the reasons 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact551	1070.57	1070.93	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	that's probably one 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact552	1072.83	1073.41	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	well yeah 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact553	1073.33	1077.17	A	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	well yeah you could look at i guess that pgm m. or something but the other is it's yep 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact554	1075.93	1076.2	E	Grad	b	-1	0	that pgm m. or something yep 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact555	1077.29	1088.77	B	Professor	s^df^ng	-1	0	but the other is it's very uh i mean even though there's the i'm sure that the yes or i uh friend has some kind of perhaps is it's it's uh still it's picking up lots of low frequency energy so

Bmr019.B.dialogueact565	1102.62	1104.75	B	Professor	s^df^ng	-1	0	but i mean if you listen to it sounds okay yeah 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact567	1106.76	1107.07	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	yeah when you listen to it 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact566	1106.64	1113.13	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	yeah when you listen to it uh the p. d. m. in the p. d. a. yeah to the he has higher sounds more but not by a lot 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact568	1113.13	1114.02	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but not by a lot it's really pretty 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact569	1114.02	1118.67	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	i just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on it's really pretty uh pretty much the same 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact570	1116.8	1119.47	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose uh pretty much the same 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact571	1120.25	1121.71	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	cheap in terms of their quality uh

Bmr019.B.dialogueact573	1122.19	1123.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well they're twenty five cents or yeah we wanted them to be to be 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact574	1122.26	1125.85	E	Grad	s	-1	0	well they're twenty five cents or yeah we wanted them to be to be typical of what would be in the p. d. a. so 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact575	1123.93	1124.04	B	Professor	b.x	-1	0	five cents or yeah be to be typical of what would

Bmr019.B.dialogueact581	1134.26	1137.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but i mean i think people use those little like for everything because they're really not 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact584	1137.09	1138.7	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because they're really not bad i

Bmr019.A.dialogueact586	1139.13	1139.57	A	PhD	b	-1	0	mean if you're not 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact585	1139.06	1147.48	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	mean if you're not doing something ridiculous like they need to speech recognizes they they they you know you can hear the sense here the sounds just fine you know it's 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact587	1147.39	1147.77	A	PhD	b	-1	0	fine you know it's 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact588	1147.54	1148.07	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	fine you know it's they i mean 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact589	1148.64	1152.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they i mean it's more or less the same principles of these other likes to build under it's just that there's 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact590	1152.31	1154.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	under it's just that there's less quality control it just turned 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact591	1154.45	1156.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it just turned him and don't check them 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact592	1158.18	1160.61	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact593	1163.06	1165.38	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	so i was yeah so was interesting is also like i said the front 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact594	1165.38	1170.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is also like i said the front and guys are very much interested in and this is as well 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact595	1170.8	1170.96	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	as well 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact596	1171.42	1172.84	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	so so but whereas this so i mean 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact597	1172.84	1174.68	F	PhD	qw^e	+1	0	yeah this so i mean what what do we go from here i mean 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact599	1174.88	1176.42	E	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah that was my question go from here i mean we so we have a we have a 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact598	1174.68	1175.07	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	yeah that was my question go from here i mean we so we have 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact600	1175.46	1178.4	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that was my question we so we have a we have a system that works pretty well but it's not 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact601	1178.4	1183.3	F	PhD	s	-1	0	well well but it's not used to using to working with so what 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact603	1183.63	1186.34	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well i think what we want to do is we want to talk about with so what 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact602	1183.3	1184.68	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	well i think what we want to do with so what 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact604	1186.34	1188.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	talk about this another other contexts we want to 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact605	1188.41	1193.29	B	Professor	s	+1	1	we want to have the ability to feed it different features 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact606	1193.88	1194.34	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and then 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact607	1194.44	1201.0	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and then um from the point of view of the front end research you would be uh substituting for t. k. 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact608	1194.45	1194.79	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and then 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact609	1201.29	1201.62	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact610	1202.21	1203.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think that's the key thing and then if 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact611	1203.53	1207.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then if we can see the different features than we can try all the different things we're trying their 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact612	1203.59	1208.07	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and then if we can see the different features than we can try all the different things we're trying their and then um 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact613	1208.16	1219.72	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and then um uh also davis is thinking about using the data in different ways uh too explicitly work kind reverberations starting 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact614	1214.82	1215.28	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	ways uh too 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact615	1219.72	1224.39	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	starting with some techniques and some other people have found someone useful so so the key 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact616	1223.17	1223.47	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	useful 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact617	1224.11	1232.46	F	PhD	s^bu	+1	1	so so the key thing that's missing here basically either ready to feed you know other features into the recognize and also 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact619	1232.87	1233.09	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	and also train this 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact618	1232.46	1234.4	F	PhD	s^bu^e	+1	1	and also train this 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact620	1234.52	1234.76	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact621	1235.5	1235.74	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and uh 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact622	1235.74	1238.16	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	and uh that's i don't know chuck over back but that's exactly 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact623	1238.24	1241.09	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	he's he's sort of back but he drove for fourteen but that's exactly what he 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact624	1239.13	1239.32	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	he's he's what he 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact625	1239.32	1240.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	he's he's sort of back but what he 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact626	1240.98	1244.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	sort of back but he drove for fourteen hours and and was going to make it in today 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact627	1242.89	1243.38	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	hours and and was going to make it in today 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact628	1243.96	1248.27	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	was going to make it in today i think that's one of the things that he 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact629	1248.62	1248.92	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact631	1250.8	1251.04	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so this it to make sure that 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact630	1250.65	1253.0	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so this it to make sure that 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact633	1253.57	1253.8	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact632	1253.15	1255.02	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact634	1260.58	1260.84	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact635	1261.54	1269.02	F	PhD	s	+1	0	it's i mean the the front and if that that's and that's i recognize it's very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly but unfortunately 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact636	1269.02	1278.92	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but unfortunately is not designed as um like the uh sixty system is where you can feed it from a pipeline that's the command so 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact637	1278.92	1286.56	F	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	that's the command so but that means probably for the foreseeable future is that uh dump out 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact638	1287.12	1291.44	F	PhD	s	+1	0	you know if you want to use them the features you have to dump them in too individual files 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact639	1292.04	1293.98	F	PhD	s	-1	0	get those five 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact640	1294.05	1295.37	E	Grad	s	+1	0	we do we tend to do that anyway 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact641	1295.63	1296.03	F	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	know so 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact642	1296.51	1296.7	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	know so 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact643	1296.88	1300.12	E	Grad	s	-1	0	know so although you you can type it as well we tend to do it that way because that way you 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact644	1300.12	1304.29	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep redoing it over and over 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact645	1304.11	1304.52	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact647	1307.47	1307.67	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bmr019.B.dialogueact648	1309.15	1310.13	B	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	yeah so it's like that's that's exactly what the 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact649	1310.01	1312.63	E	Grad	s	-1	0	that's exactly what the p. file is for 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact650	1313.01	1313.26	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah but the 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact651	1313.49	1319.36	F	PhD	fg|s	+1	0	yeah but the the cumbersome thing is is um is that you actually have to talk about little little five so for each segment 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact652	1314.04	1314.22	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the cumbersome thing is 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact653	1319.36	1324.47	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so for each segment that you want a wreck separate fly 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact654	1324.58	1324.85	E	Grad	b	-1	0	fly 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact655	1325.54	1329.03	F	PhD	s	-1	0	just like it they like as if there were these away from segment but that you have future feature 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact656	1329.03	1331.15	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but that you have future feature file eichmann 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact657	1333.2	1333.9	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact658	1336.17	1336.46	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact659	1339.17	1339.37	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	well 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact660	1340.45	1343.51	B	Professor	fg|qo^d^e	-1	0	okay so the the actually we have an agenda was something alignment lineman 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact661	1345.1	1345.39	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact662	1346.41	1347.43	A	PhD	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	yes we have 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact663	1348.42	1348.67	A	PhD	s^bd^no	-1	0	uh did you want 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact664	1348.67	1349.73	A	PhD	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	uh did you want to talk about it or 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact665	1349.73	1350.0	A	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	to talk about it or you know i was just 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact666	1350.2	1351.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you know i was just telling this to jane 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact667	1351.96	1365.35	A	PhD	s	+1	2	telling this to jane and we we we were able to get some dustin prove men on the forced alignment they looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring and 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact668	1365.35	1366.76	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact669	1367.19	1373.3	A	PhD	s	-1	0	some years occurring very frequently or just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible and the recognition which is uh 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact670	1373.3	1378.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	which is uh i think was both the uprooting problem and 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact671	1378.51	1384.74	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and possibly uh problem with needing constraints on word locations and so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact672	1384.74	1386.82	A	PhD	s	-1	0	locations and so we tried both these things we tried 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact673	1386.82	1387.53	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	things we tried saying 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact674	1388.4	1388.68	A	PhD	s^bk^no	-1	0	i don't know i got this 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact675	1388.68	1396.22	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i don't know i got this wacky idea that just from looking at the data that when people talk their words are usually chunk together 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact676	1397.33	1400.87	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it's not that they say one word and then there's a bunch of work together 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact677	1401.2	1404.88	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	they might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just back channels 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact678	1405.27	1411.9	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but in general if there's like five or six words and one words far away from it that's probably wrong i married so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact679	1411.9	1413.56	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	i married so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact680	1414.68	1418.75	A	PhD	s	-1	0	then also cut the printing of course was too severe so it's actually 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact681	1418.41	1419.72	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	too severe so it's actually interesting the pruning 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact682	1419.72	1422.54	F	PhD	s	-1	0	interesting the pruning was the same value that they use for recognition 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact683	1423.25	1429.91	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and we had low it that we had used tighter fronting after lives ransom experiment showing that you know it runs slower and 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact684	1429.91	1432.09	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	actually it was better with slightly know it runs slower and there's no real difference in 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact686	1431.35	1434.07	A	PhD	s^ng.%--	+1	1	actually it was better with slightly better about this it was the same with tighter real difference in so 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact685	1431.24	1431.76	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	actually it was real difference in 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact688	1434.07	1435.48	A	PhD	s^e^ng	+1	0	it was the same with tighter from so for free recognition 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact687	1433.65	1433.94	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	better about this 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact689	1435.01	1438.64	F	PhD	s	+1	0	from for free recognition this the lower pruning values is better 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact691	1439.0	1445.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	probably because the recognitions just bad yeah the point where it's bad enough that that you don't lose anything but it turned 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact690	1438.97	1439.18	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	probably because the recognitions is better 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact692	1442.19	1442.41	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	where it's bad enough 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact693	1443.67	1443.88	F	PhD	b	-1	0	that 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact694	1445.01	1452.15	F	PhD	fg|s	+1	1	but it turned out for for to get accurate alignment that was really important to open up the phone significantly 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact695	1451.26	1451.58	A	PhD	b	-1	0	significantly 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact696	1452.37	1452.64	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact697	1452.75	1460.31	F	PhD	fh|s^df	-1	0	because otherwise it would so do greedy alignment um and reasons where there was no real speech yet from the foreground seeker 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact698	1460.49	1460.9	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact699	1461.22	1464.84	F	PhD	s	+1	1	so that was one big factor that help improve things and then 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact700	1464.84	1466.83	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	improve things and then the other thing was 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact701	1467.78	1474.79	F	PhD	s	+1	1	as i said the we enforce the fact that uh the foreground speech has to be continuous it cannot 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact702	1474.79	1480.99	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	continuous it cannot be you can't have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact703	1481.22	1483.83	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you can only have background speech at the beginning and the end 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact704	1484.46	1486.15	A	PhD	fg|s^arp	-1	0	yeah i mean it isn't always true and i think what 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact705	1486.15	1489.33	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	and i think what we really wanted some clever way to do this where 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact706	1489.33	1495.15	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	where um you know from the data are for maybe some hand corrected alignments from transcribers that things like 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact707	1495.69	1504.25	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	things like words that do occur just by themselves oh on like back channels or something that we did allow to have back on speech right those would 
Bmr019.D.dialogueact708	1501.41	1501.6	D	PhD	b	-1	0	or something that we 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact709	1504.6	1505.8	A	PhD	s	+1	1	those would be able to do that but the 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact710	1504.88	1505.2	C	Postdoc	s^fa.%	-1	0	those would be able to do that but the 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact711	1505.8	1507.56	A	PhD	s	+1	1	be able to do that but the rest would be constrained 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact712	1508.67	1512.79	A	PhD	s	+1	0	so i think we have version it's pretty good for the native speakers i don't 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact713	1512.79	1514.72	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	speakers i don't know yet about the non native speakers 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact714	1515.71	1516.76	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact715	1517.83	1523.7	A	PhD	s	-1	0	we basically also made noise models for the different groups of uh miles noises together 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact716	1524.44	1526.82	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	um so and then there's a background speech model 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact717	1527.47	1528.36	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and we also there was some neat 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact718	1528.46	1530.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	there was some neat are interesting cases like 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact719	1530.83	1534.56	A	PhD	s	-1	0	cases like there's one meeting where um jose is giving a presentation and he's talking 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact720	1534.56	1538.51	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	and he's talking about um the word mixed signal and someone 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact721	1538.51	1542.08	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	and someone didn't understand um that you were saying next thing morgan 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact722	1542.33	1542.92	A	PhD	s	-1	0	thing morgan 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact724	1543.48	1548.11	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	and so your speech was saying something about mixing on the next turn 
Bmr019.H.dialogueact723	1543.26	1543.9	H	PhD	b	-1	0	and so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact725	1548.11	1552.86	A	PhD	s	-1	0	on the next turn was it a lot of people saying mixed like 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact726	1552.86	1554.94	A	PhD	s^e:s	-1	0	mixed like he means mixing or i think it's mixed in 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact727	1554.94	1557.84	A	PhD	s	-1	0	think it's mixed in the word mixed in this segment occurs like a bunch of times 
Bmr019.H.dialogueact728	1555.01	1555.66	H	PhD	%-	-1	0	the word mixed in this 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact729	1558.39	1560.07	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and checks on the will tell here and he also says mix 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact730	1560.07	1561.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and he also says mix but it's up the last 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact731	1561.32	1562.46	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	but it's up the last one and of course or 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact732	1562.46	1565.89	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	one and of course or the lines everywhere else to everybody else is mixed yeah 
Bmr019.H.dialogueact733	1565.74	1565.96	H	PhD	b	-1	0	else is mixed yeah 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact734	1566.39	1567.65	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because there's no adaptation yet so there's 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact735	1567.65	1571.17	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yet so there's i think there's some issues about we probably want to adapt 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact736	1571.17	1574.39	A	PhD	s^cs^rt	+1	1	we probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker but i guess 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact737	1574.39	1579.01	A	PhD	s	+1	1	but i guess i guess try to decking both the foreground and background generic speaker and that's actually a little bit 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact738	1579.01	1582.41	A	PhD	s^ba	+1	1	and that's actually a little bit of a funky model like it gives 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact739	1582.41	1584.19	A	PhD	s	+1	1	model like it gives you some weird alignments just because off in the 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact740	1584.19	1588.24	A	PhD	s^df	+1	1	just because off in the background speakers match better to the foreground in the foreground speaker so there's some things 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact741	1584.89	1585.15	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	just because off in the background speakers match 
Bmr019.D.dialogueact742	1587.68	1587.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	in the foreground speaker 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact744	1588.24	1589.4	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so there's some things there especially 
Bmr019.H.dialogueact743	1587.96	1588.37	H	PhD	b	-1	0	in the foreground speaker so there's some things 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact745	1589.64	1593.32	A	PhD	s^df^e	-1	0	there especially when you get lots of the same words uh occurring in uh well that i i think 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact746	1592.41	1592.84	F	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	uh occurring well that 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact747	1593.69	1597.39	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	in uh i i think you can do better by uh cloning so we have a reject 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact748	1597.39	1598.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so we have a reject phone 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact749	1599.43	1608.09	F	PhD	s	+1	1	what we wanted to try it with you know once we have this paper it's none of them on time that cloning that reject model and then one copy 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact750	1608.09	1613.65	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground like fragments 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact751	1613.65	1614.72	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	the foreground like fragments and stuff and the 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact752	1614.72	1617.66	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and stuff and the other hobby would be adapted to the background speaker 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact753	1618.5	1620.23	A	PhD	fg|s.%-	-1	0	right i mean in general we actually right now the 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact754	1619.01	1619.28	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	in general we actually 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact755	1620.51	1624.29	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	right now the words like personal words or reject models and you 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact757	1624.85	1627.1	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and you know really allow those to match any word but then the background 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact756	1624.45	1624.78	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	and you 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact758	1627.1	1629.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but then the background speech was also a reject model 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact759	1630.08	1632.54	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and so this constraint of not allowing rejection between you know needs 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact760	1632.54	1634.42	A	PhD	s	-1	0	between you know needs to differentiate between the two so just 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact761	1634.42	1638.48	A	PhD	s	+1	1	the two so just sort of working through a bunch of t bugging kinds of issues 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact762	1634.99	1635.23	F	PhD	b	-1	0	the two so just sort of working through a bunch 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact763	1639.21	1642.47	A	PhD	s.%--:s.%--	-1	0	another one is turns like people starting with well i think in someone else's 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact764	1642.47	1644.53	A	PhD	s.%--:qo.%--	-1	0	think in someone else's well how about the the word well 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact765	1644.52	1648.98	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	about the the word well as in this in this segment multiple times and 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact766	1648.98	1652.99	A	PhD	s	-1	0	multiple times and as soon as it occurs usually deal or will try to online it to the first person who says it 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact767	1653.46	1660.58	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but then that constraint of sort of uh proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it general is the proximity constraint hard 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact768	1659.78	1661.85	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	who really said it general is the proximity constraint hard constraints or 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact769	1661.85	1664.86	E	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	i know constraints or did you do some sort of probable is quitting distance we we didn't know we 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact770	1663.72	1664.53	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i know probable is quitting distance we we didn't know we 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact772	1664.7	1666.18	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i know it's a kluge distance didn't know we were okay we 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact771	1664.58	1664.99	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	i know distance didn't know we 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact773	1664.99	1665.47	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	i know it's a kluge distance didn't know we were 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact774	1666.31	1666.69	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	okay we 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact775	1666.75	1673.24	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	okay we it's it's so it's actually just have the the penalty that doesn't completely this allows it but the scars that but 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact776	1673.83	1678.77	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	the vet level yeah that but um we just didn't have time to play with you know tuning now another yet another traveler 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact777	1676.88	1677.69	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	the vet level yeah with you know tuning now another yet 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact778	1677.69	1678.02	E	Grad	b	-1	0	vet level yeah now another yet another traveler 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact779	1678.69	1679.08	A	PhD	b	-1	0	another traveler and really the reason we 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact780	1679.09	1683.43	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have it we don't have ground truth for these so 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact781	1683.66	1688.42	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	for these so we would need a hand marked um would level alignments what he's 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact782	1688.48	1692.78	F	PhD	s^cs^e	+1	1	what he's sort of the boundary stuff the speech it's you know between the speakers 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact783	1693.33	1695.61	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and then use that as a reference and tune 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact784	1695.61	1701.33	F	PhD	s	+1	1	get given i mean i a reference and tune the premise of the of the models uh two up to get the best 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact785	1700.46	1700.87	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	get 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact786	1700.81	1707.0	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	i looked get given i mean i i was i was going to ask anyway uh how you assess things were better 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact787	1703.18	1703.84	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	uh 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact788	1707.62	1708.8	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i looked at them i spent 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact789	1708.8	1711.66	A	PhD	s	-1	0	at them i spent two days um in waves oh 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact790	1708.94	1709.25	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	at them i spent two days 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact791	1711.92	1713.1	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	oh most painful because 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact792	1713.1	1716.42	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the thing is you know the lyman share a lot in common so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact793	1716.42	1716.74	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact794	1717.1	1720.05	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and you you're you're looking at these segments where there's a lot of speech i mean a lot of them have a lot of 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact795	1720.05	1721.49	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean a lot of them have a lot of words 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact797	1722.11	1723.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	not by every speaker by by some speaker 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact796	1721.75	1722.09	B	Professor	b	-1	0	words not by every speaker 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact798	1723.08	1725.17	A	PhD	s	-1	0	by by some speaker there's a lot of fort no not i mean that 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact801	1725.16	1725.56	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	no not i mean that 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact799	1724.83	1725.06	B	Professor	b	-1	0	there's a lot of fort no not i mean that 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact802	1725.56	1731.31	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	no not i mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words but altogether 
Bmr019.H.dialogueact800	1725.1	1726.98	H	PhD	%-	-1	0	no not i mean that if you look 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact803	1729.34	1729.58	B	Professor	b	-1	0	from just one person 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact806	1731.31	1733.53	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	words but altogether you'll see a lot of words up there and so the reject 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact805	1731.16	1731.41	B	Professor	b	-1	0	words but altogether 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact804	1730.95	1731.45	F	PhD	b	-1	0	you don't see a lot of words but altogether 
Bmr019.D.dialogueact808	1733.53	1733.69	D	PhD	b	-1	0	up there and so the reject 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact807	1733.53	1736.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	up there and so the reject is also mapping pauses so i looked 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact809	1736.69	1738.02	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	so i looked at a mall in ways and just lined up all these 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact810	1738.02	1740.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and just lined up all these alignments and at first 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact811	1740.16	1742.21	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and at first it sort of looks like a mass and then the more i 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact812	1742.21	1745.81	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	and then the more i looked at it okay well it's moving these words left word and 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact813	1745.81	1747.88	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	left word and you know it wasn't that bad it was 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact814	1747.88	1749.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it wasn't that bad it was just doing certain things wrong so but 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact815	1749.32	1749.68	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	wrong so but 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact816	1749.99	1753.79	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	wrong so but i don't you know have time to to look at all of them and it would 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact817	1753.79	1757.83	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	look at all of them and it would be really useful to have like a a transcriber who couldn't use ways 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact818	1758.39	1763.56	A	PhD	s^cs^e	-1	0	um just marked like the beginning and and of the foreground speakers real words at the beginning 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact819	1763.56	1765.97	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	words at the beginning of the first word and the the last word and 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact821	1765.97	1768.97	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the last word and then we could yeah i do some adjustments okay i have to ask you something which is for smoke 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact820	1765.67	1765.74	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	the last word and 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact822	1766.84	1767.44	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	then we could yeah i do okay i have to ask you something 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact823	1767.44	1768.29	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah i do some adjustments okay i have to ask you something which is for smoke 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact824	1771.54	1776.48	C	Postdoc	s^cs^df	-1	0	wage because if we could benefit from what you did incorporate that into the present transfers that would help and 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact825	1772.47	1772.8	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	if we could benefit 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact826	1776.87	1780.27	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	that would help and then um the other thing is i believe that i did hand so one 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact827	1780.42	1784.43	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so one of these transcripts was gone over by transcriber and then i had 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact828	1784.43	1791.18	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then i had market myself so that we do have the beginning and ending up individual utter and says um

Bmr019.A.dialogueact847	1820.8	1824.96	A	PhD	s	+1	1	reactions you know interface wise if you're looking at speech you want to be able to know really where the words are and that's right 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact849	1824.96	1829.13	A	PhD	s	+1	0	where the words are and so we can give you some examples of sort of what the cell put looks like um and that's right middle the order

Bmr019.C.dialogueact868	1860.85	1861.12	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay he was you know it i think so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact871	1861.35	1861.69	A	PhD	b	-1	0	he was you know it think so 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact870	1861.12	1862.07	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i mean he was you know it it seems like she she's think so

Bmr019.A.dialogueact873	1862.22	1862.72	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i mean it seems like she she's 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact874	1862.26	1864.78	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i mean it seems like she she's but she's moving time marks around since 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact872	1861.78	1862.0	F	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean he was you know it it seems like she she's think so 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact875	1864.99	1871.04	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	yeah it be advance would just be that marks around since our presentation in transcriber uses time mark seems like there should be some way of of using that benefiting from that 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact876	1867.78	1868.05	E	Grad	b	-1	0	time mark seems like there should be some way of 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact877	1870.28	1877.51	A	PhD	fg|s	+1	1	yeah it be advance would just be that when you brought up a band you would be able if you were zoomed in enough in transcriber to see all the word you would be able benefiting from that 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact878	1875.98	1876.43	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	in transcriber to see all 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact879	1877.51	1880.53	A	PhD	s	+1	1	the word you would be able to like have the words that are located in time 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact880	1881.02	1881.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	he wanted to do that so so if 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact881	1881.07	1886.63	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	he wanted to do that so so so if we even just edit it sounds like we we we almost do uh 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact882	1882.19	1882.36	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so we even just 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact883	1886.92	1888.16	B	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	do uh if we were to yeah just we have to

Bmr019.A.dialogueact916	1932.72	1933.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the new new it was a medium new but 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact915	1932.6	1932.86	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	the new new it was 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact917	1933.83	1937.18	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	a medium new but but we would we should do the the latest version was the one yeah you did you adjust 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact918	1933.92	1934.16	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	a medium new but but we would 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact919	1936.07	1936.52	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	the latest version you 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact921	1937.4	1938.77	A	PhD	s	-1	0	was the one from last week did you adjust uh 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact920	1936.91	1942.42	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	the latest version was the one from last week yes yes i did you did you adjust uh hundreds of times um for each channel 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact922	1941.02	1941.31	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	um for each channel 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact923	1942.62	1943.11	C	Postdoc	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yes i did and furthermore i found 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact924	1943.11	1952.94	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and furthermore i found that there were certain number where not not a lot but several times i actually moved in outer ends from adam's channel to dance or from danced adam so 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact925	1952.94	1953.92	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	danced adam so there was some speakers of 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact926	1954.22	1960.98	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and the reason was because i transcribe that the point before uh before we had the multiple audio available so 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact927	1961.09	1961.17	C	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	i couldn't switch 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact928	1961.17	1962.68	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i couldn't switch between the auto i i 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact929	1962.68	1965.04	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	between the auto i i transcribed off of the next channel entirely which meant in overlaps 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact930	1965.04	1967.68	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which meant in overlaps i was in a terrific disadvantage in 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact931	1966.79	1967.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i was in a terrific disadvantage in 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact932	1967.76	1968.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	disadvantage in addition it was before the 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact933	1967.96	1970.91	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	disadvantage in addition it was before the channel iced um possibly was there 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact934	1971.16	1976.52	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and finally i did it using speakers of my am of you know off the c. p. u. on my on my machine because i didn't have 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact935	1976.52	1977.54	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	my machine because i didn't have a headphone so it's 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact937	1977.84	1978.28	A	PhD	b	-1	0	a headphone so it's like i mean yeah i 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact936	1977.54	1978.4	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	a headphone so it's like i mean yeah i 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact938	1978.73	1983.47	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	like i mean yeah i mean in retrospect would have been good to have got i should've gotten had but in any case

Bmr019.G.dialogueact962	2017.83	2018.76	G	Grad	s	-1	0	you would drop somebody but then 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact963	2018.76	2020.51	G	Grad	s	-1	0	drop somebody but then there's no line after africa but the 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact964	2020.51	2023.28	G	Grad	s	-1	0	after africa but the speaker identification after that line you know you're talking 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact965	2022.39	2022.6	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	after that line 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact966	2023.72	2024.43	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	you know you're talking take mulder were there miss labeling 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact967	2024.43	2027.06	G	Grad	qrr	-1	0	that was fixed um take mulder were there miss labeling as far as like eight adam was 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact968	2027.28	2029.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that was fixed um before i i yeah because it's 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact969	2029.34	2031.34	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i i think i i think i understood that pretty thank you for mention you yeah because it's not like you know about that yeah 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact970	2029.68	2031.21	G	Grad	fg|s^df	-1	0	i i think i i think i understood that pretty thank you for mention you yeah because it's not like you know about that yeah 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact971	2031.34	2031.97	C	Postdoc	s^ft	-1	0	pretty thank you for mention you yeah 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact973	2031.97	2035.35	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	pretty thank you for mention you know that that that i think when awake couple versions ago but there's no yeah okay but you're actually saying that certain 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact972	2031.76	2032.15	G	Grad	s^fw	-1	0	pretty thank you for mention you know that that that yeah 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact974	2034.59	2034.96	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	couple versions ago okay but 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact976	2035.35	2036.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but there's no you're actually saying that certain guys do gooder business 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact975	2034.96	2037.78	G	Grad	s	+1	1	couple versions ago but there's no yeah so with okay but you're actually saying that certain guys do gooder business identify 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact977	2037.13	2045.98	C	Postdoc	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah so with under i'm listening to the next channel there were times when as surprising is that is i got adam's voice confused dance and vice versa not identify okay 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact978	2044.27	2044.61	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	voice confused dance okay 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact979	2045.98	2047.07	C	Postdoc	s^bd^df	-1	0	and vice versa not for long better insist but just just a couple okay 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact980	2046.11	2046.33	G	Grad	b	-1	0	for long better insist okay 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact981	2046.95	2047.37	A	PhD	b	-1	0	for long better insist but just just a couple okay 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact982	2047.07	2048.63	C	Postdoc	s^bd^e	-1	0	but just just a couple of places 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact983	2048.94	2049.36	B	Professor	b	-1	0	of places and bad 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact984	2049.36	2050.88	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and bad in bed in ross the other 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact985	2050.88	2056.68	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	right in bed in ross the other thing that was interesting to me was that i picked up a lot of um back channels which were hidden in the mexico which you 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact987	2056.93	2057.45	A	PhD	b	-1	0	right the mexico which you know you can not not too surprising 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact986	2056.68	2058.37	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	right the mexico which you know you can not not too surprising but the other 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact988	2058.69	2059.73	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but the other thing that 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact989	2060.07	2061.3	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i i haven't thought about this but i thought i wanted 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact990	2061.3	2066.45	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this but i thought i wanted raises when you're that with respect also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially but that's 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact991	2066.45	2066.86	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but that's 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact992	2067.79	2079.62	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	when i was looking at these back channels differ turning up usually very often and i usually anyway very often i picked them up in a channel which wise the person who had asked the question 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact993	2080.0	2082.94	C	Postdoc	s:qy	-1	0	so if someone says and and have you done this so and so 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact994	2083.46	2084.76	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then they would be back channels but it would 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact995	2084.76	2086.32	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	back channels but it would be the person who asked the question other people weren't really 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact996	2086.32	2088.28	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	other people weren't really doing much back channeling and 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact997	2088.74	2090.73	C	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	well that's interesting and you know sometimes you have a yeah 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact998	2089.6	2090.63	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	well that's interesting you know sometimes you have a yeah 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1000	2091.4	2091.85	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah i mean it it wouldn't be perfect 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact999	2091.05	2092.3	C	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	yeah i mean it it wouldn't be perfect but but it does seem 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1001	2092.3	2097.23	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	no that's really interesting but but it does seem more natural to give it back channel when when you're somehow involved in the topic and the most natural 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1002	2093.43	2094.78	A	PhD	s^ar|s^ba	-1	0	no that's really interesting more natural to give it back channel when 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1004	2097.48	2097.85	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and the most natural 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1003	2097.23	2100.49	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and the most natural ways for you to initiates topic i think i 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1005	2099.5	2099.98	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	topic i think 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1007	2101.28	2102.22	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	that's interesting think no i think it's actually i think what's 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1006	2100.99	2101.31	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that's interesting i think no i think it's 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1008	2101.31	2107.1	F	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	that's interesting think no i think it's actually i think what's going on inspection thing is something that happens and to party conversations and if you ask someone 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1009	2107.08	2107.3	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and if you ask someone 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1010	2107.1	2111.35	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	well actually yeah and if you ask someone a question you essentially initiating a little too party conversation so 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1011	2110.89	2110.95	C	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	too party conversation 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1012	2111.54	2113.31	A	PhD	s	-1	0	well actually yeah when we looked at this so then your rights and then you're expected to back 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1014	2112.07	2112.68	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	when we looked at this then your rights and then 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1013	2111.98	2114.39	F	PhD	s	-1	0	well actually yeah when we looked at this so then your rights and then you're expected to back channel because the 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1015	2114.39	2117.29	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	exactly exactly my point channel because the person addressing you directly and not everybody 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1016	2115.81	2116.32	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	exactly person addressing you directly and not everybody 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1017	2117.23	2118.01	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	exactly my point and and so this is the expectation 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1019	2118.01	2120.08	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and and so this is the expectation thing that it would be just the diet but in addition 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1018	2117.82	2118.02	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	exactly my point and and so this is the expectation 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1020	2118.02	2118.49	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and and so this is the expectation 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1021	2118.66	2118.96	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and and so this is the expectation 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1022	2118.91	2119.12	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and and so this is the expectation thing that it would 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1024	2120.08	2120.72	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	be just the diet but in addition 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1023	2119.86	2120.09	F	PhD	b	-1	0	thing that it would be just the diet but in addition 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1025	2120.72	2130.63	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	right it's i tell you i say i say be just the diet but in addition you know if someone has done this analysis himself and his involved in the diet but they might also give back channels to verify what what the answer is it's just that the the answers 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1026	2121.99	2122.13	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	you know if someone has done this 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1028	2129.91	2130.29	A	PhD	b	-1	0	right it's i tell you i say i say just that the the answers 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1027	2129.85	2131.73	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	right it's well i tell you i say i say uhhuh lot just that the the answers 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1029	2130.62	2130.86	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	it's you i say i say answers 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1030	2131.51	2131.87	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well uhhuh lot 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1031	2132.05	2133.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but it's interesting because uh well people are talking 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1032	2133.08	2133.81	A	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	because uh well people are talking 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1033	2133.55	2134.84	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	because uh well people are talking to each other there 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1035	2135.44	2137.87	A	PhD	s^ng:s	+1	1	but there are few words i think there are fewer uh how as i you go yeah 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1034	2135.01	2135.41	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but there are few you go yeah 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1036	2135.75	2135.91	C	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	but there are few you go yeah 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1037	2136.71	2136.86	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	words i think there are fewer 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1038	2138.01	2144.88	A	PhD	s	-1	0	mean just from we were looking word frequency listed try to find the cases that we would allowed to have the reject words in between and doing alignment 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1039	2145.21	2147.52	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you know the ones when constrain to be next in other words 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1040	2145.45	2146.06	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	you know the ones when constrain to be next in other 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1041	2148.3	2151.32	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	and uhhuh is not as frequent as 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1042	2152.03	2153.78	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it sort of would be an switchboard if you 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1043	2153.78	2157.86	A	PhD	s^e	+1	0	an switchboard if you look at just a word frequency list of one word short outer says isn't yeah 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1044	2157.86	2159.22	A	PhD	s:s	+1	1	outer says isn't yeah is way up there but not uhhuh and 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1045	2159.22	2159.96	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	there but not uhhuh and 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1046	2159.96	2160.83	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	there but not uhhuh and so i was thinking 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1047	2161.57	2166.67	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it's it's not like you're being encouraged by everybody else to keep talking in a meeting and i that's 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1048	2166.67	2168.14	A	PhD	s	-1	0	in a meeting and i that's all it i'll stop there because i think what you well that's right and that 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1049	2168.14	2170.09	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because i think what you say makes sense but it was sort of well that's right and that would well i and what 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1050	2168.19	2168.73	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	because i think what you well that's right and that 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1051	2168.73	2169.14	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	because i think what you say makes sense well that's right and that would well 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1053	2170.15	2170.88	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but it was sort of i and what 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1052	2170.03	2170.79	C	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	but it was sort of i and what 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1054	2170.87	2173.4	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it was sort of i and what you say is is there or other side of the switches that 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1055	2173.4	2178.91	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	of the switches that you know you so if they're lots of channels where you don't have these back channels when a question has been asked 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1056	2178.95	2180.1	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	right there's just probably less has been asked and and these 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1057	2179.48	2179.83	A	PhD	b	-1	0	right there's and and these 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1058	2179.98	2183.31	A	PhD	s	-1	0	right there's just probably less back channeling in general even and and these so that's good news really 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1059	2180.48	2180.59	C	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	just probably less 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1060	2182.3	2183.42	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	in general even so that's good news really 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1061	2183.7	2188.99	A	PhD	s	-1	0	even if you consider every other person altogether one person and then eating really 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1062	2189.07	2190.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but we'll find out anyway we're 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1063	2190.27	2198.56	A	PhD	s	+1	1	we're i guess the other thing we're we're should say is that we're going to um to compare this type of overlapping announces to switchboard 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1065	2199.16	2199.51	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	where and call 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1064	2198.94	2199.59	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	where and call 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1066	2199.64	2200.3	A	PhD	s^m^na	+1	0	where and call home where we have both 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1067	2200.3	2208.19	A	PhD	qrr	+1	1	home where we have both sides so that we can try to answer this question of you know is the really more overlapping meetings or is it just because they don't have the other channels on switchboard we don't know what people 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1069	2201.39	2202.0	B	Professor	b	-1	0	sides so that we can try to answer this question 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1068	2201.37	2201.81	E	Grad	b	-1	0	sides so that we can try 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1070	2208.19	2209.44	A	PhD	s	+1	0	we don't know what people are doing 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1071	2210.02	2211.42	A	PhD	s	-1	0	try to create a paper 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1072	2212.02	2215.03	B	Professor	fg|s^df	-1	0	yeah i mean you first probably pretty told me but where are 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1073	2215.03	2218.5	B	Professor	qy	+1	0	but where are you intending to of your speech commission 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1074	2218.5	2218.53	B	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1075	2219.68	2221.07	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	um you mean one due tomorrow yeah 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1076	2221.33	2221.55	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1077	2221.97	2225.93	A	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah well we still like reading the script or doing the research and 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1078	2226.02	2227.89	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	we will yes we're going to try 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1079	2226.43	2226.86	C	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	we will yes 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1080	2229.6	2234.74	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and i was telling don do not take this as an example of how people should work do 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1081	2234.99	2235.95	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	should work so do as i say 
Bmr019.G.dialogueact1082	2235.31	2235.76	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so as i say 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1083	2235.94	2237.71	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	so we will try it'll as i say if there was i do yeah 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1084	2235.95	2237.08	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	so we will try it'll as i say if there was i do yeah 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1085	2237.08	2237.34	B	Professor	b	-1	0	we will try it'll yeah 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1087	2237.71	2239.02	A	PhD	s	-1	0	we will try it'll probably be a little late but right right yeah it is different previous 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1086	2237.6	2237.85	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	we will try it'll yeah 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1089	2239.06	2240.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but right right it is different previous years your speech 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1088	2239.04	2239.6	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but right right it is different previous 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1090	2239.6	2242.85	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but right right it is different previous years your speech only had the abstract do by now not

Bmr019.E.dialogueact1095	2245.55	2247.09	E	Grad	s	-1	0	was off i've given up on trying to do digits i just don't think that 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1096	2247.09	2250.31	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i just don't think that what i have so far makes uh your speech paper 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1097	2251.13	2253.14	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	well i mean we may be in the same position and i figured 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1098	2253.14	2255.26	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and i figured well try because that'll at least 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1099	2255.26	2261.63	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	because that'll at least get us to the point where we have we have this really nice database format that address and i were working out that it 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1100	2262.02	2263.17	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it's not very fancy it's just uh 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1101	2263.17	2265.84	A	PhD	s	+1	0	it's just uh asking why my line format but 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1102	2265.84	2267.45	A	PhD	s	-1	0	line format but it does give you information this 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1103	2266.7	2268.88	F	PhD	s	+1	1	it does give you information it this bird formats 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1104	2269.04	2270.96	A	PhD	s:s	+1	0	yeah we're tiny spirits after chase i

Bmr019.F.dialogueact1168	2334.91	2338.76	F	PhD	s	-1	0	how to do it better but three so we're taking these uh alignment from the little channels

Bmr019.F.dialogueact1171	2344.0	2349.0	F	PhD	s	+1	0	essentially has it's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word in the direction 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1174	2350.62	2353.0	A	PhD	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	it looks like a ways label file almost right just and and and of course right but it has one

Bmr019.F.dialogueact1175	2352.71	2356.19	F	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	almost right just right but it has one the first column has a meeting name so i could actually 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1177	2356.42	2358.44	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so i could actually contains several meetings um 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1178	2358.44	2358.75	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1179	2359.37	2360.64	F	PhD	s	+1	0	and the thing comes the channel 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1180	2361.5	2366.53	F	PhD	s	+1	0	start columbus stuff start times of the words the forthcoming this the duration of the words 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1181	2367.53	2368.39	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and then where 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1182	2369.74	2370.47	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1183	2372.0	2379.43	F	PhD	fg|s	+1	0	then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of words the uh tags for like 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1184	2379.43	2382.12	F	PhD	s^e	+1	0	for like where were sentence and the sentence question marks

Bmr019.F.dialogueact1186	2383.53	2385.58	F	PhD	fh|s^e	-1	0	yeah these are things various other things 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1187	2385.59	2387.34	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah these are things that we had done saddam sort of things 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1188	2385.79	2386.07	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah these are things that we had done things 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1189	2387.34	2392.22	A	PhD	s	-1	0	saddam sort of um propagate is deep punctuation from the original transcribers the weather was like question 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1190	2388.19	2388.48	F	PhD	b	-1	0	um propagate 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1191	2392.22	2397.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the weather was like question marker period or you know calm and things like that and 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1192	2397.65	2406.93	A	PhD	s	-1	0	like that and we kept and just fluency dash uh kept those in because we sort of want to know where those are relative to the for overlaps so 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1193	2400.38	2400.62	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1194	2406.57	2406.74	F	PhD	b	-1	0	overlaps so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1196	2407.31	2408.49	A	PhD	s^bsc	-1	0	overlaps or so those are actually so the retrofit 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1195	2406.84	2410.53	F	PhD	s	-1	0	overlaps overlaps or so so those are actually so the retrofit it into the time allotment 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1197	2408.49	2408.6	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	or so the retrofit 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1198	2411.43	2414.93	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and then we merged all the alignments from the various channels and 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1199	2414.93	2416.39	F	PhD	s	+1	1	various channels and we sort of my time 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1200	2418.56	2425.43	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and then there's a then there's a process where you are now determine the spurts 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1201	2426.11	2429.26	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that is actually know you do that before you merced farris channel so you you had 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1202	2429.26	2431.77	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so you you had identified by some cuts here and which 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1203	2431.87	2432.93	F	PhD	s	-1	0	cuts here and which is paul things 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1204	2433.39	2436.25	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you identified the beginnings and ends of these parts and you put another 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1205	2436.25	2439.4	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight and 
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1206	2437.96	2438.38	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	set of tags in there to keep those 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1207	2440.05	2444.77	F	PhD	s	-1	0	then you merge everything in terms of you know when you're rising the sequence based on the time mark 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1208	2445.45	2450.31	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and then you extract the end of it visual channels again but this time 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1209	2450.31	2454.24	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but this time you know where the other people start and and talking you know where they're 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1210	2454.58	2456.23	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you know where they're spurts started and 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1211	2457.23	2462.6	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and so you extract the individual channels uh once sport iceberg everywhere 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1212	2463.17	2468.76	F	PhD	s	+1	1	um and inside the words are between the words you know have begin and and hag for overlap so 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1213	2468.9	2479.33	F	PhD	s	+1	0	i mean for overlap so you you basically have everything for the flying up and in a forum where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1214	2478.92	2479.11	E	Grad	b	-1	0	i mean speakers 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1215	2479.89	2482.4	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean i think that's actually really useful also because 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1216	2479.97	2480.35	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	i mean i think that's actually 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1217	2482.4	2494.17	A	PhD	qo^df	+1	0	also because even if you weren't studying overlaps if you want to get a transcription for these far afield mike how are you going to know which whereas from which speakers occurred at which times relative to each other you have to be able 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1218	2494.17	2499.34	A	PhD	s	+1	0	other you have to be able to get a transcript like like this anyway just for doing for field recognition so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1219	2499.34	2499.65	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1220	2500.44	2501.91	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you know it's it's sort of 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1221	2500.87	2501.15	F	PhD	b	-1	0	you know it's it's sort of 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1222	2502.45	2504.4	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i see it's just an issue we haven't dealt with before how you timeline 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1223	2504.4	2506.95	A	PhD	s^e.x	-1	0	before how you timeline things that are overlapping anyway 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1225	2508.68	2509.42	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	i mean that's wonderful so and and we 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1224	2508.58	2508.97	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	that's wonderful so

Bmr019.A.dialogueact1239	2523.39	2525.93	A	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah this is like a poor man's avert the formatting version but 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1240	2525.93	2527.39	A	PhD	s	-1	0	formatting version but it's you know it's clean it's just not fancy 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1241	2527.39	2528.48	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it's just not fancy well 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1242	2528.56	2528.76	E	Grad	b	-1	0	well 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1244	2529.23	2529.72	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	there's lots of little things 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1243	2528.79	2530.18	F	PhD	s	-1	0	well there's lots of little things like that 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1245	2530.18	2533.48	F	PhD	s	-1	0	like that twelve different scripts which you're right and then at the 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1246	2533.48	2535.06	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you're right and then at the end you have what you want but um 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1247	2535.06	2536.04	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	but um at the very 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1248	2536.67	2540.02	F	PhD	s	-1	0	at the very last stage we throw away the actual time information all we care about is whether 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1249	2540.02	2545.64	F	PhD	s	+1	0	we care about is whether that there's a certain word was overlap by someone else afford so 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1250	2546.01	2551.39	F	PhD	s	+1	0	you sort of at that point you disc or ties things into just having overlap or no overlap 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1251	2552.05	2556.61	F	PhD	s^df	+1	0	because we figured that's about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper 
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1252	2555.76	2556.27	E	Grad	b	-1	0	want to do for this paper 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1253	2557.33	2563.64	F	PhD	s:qw	-1	0	yeah but if you wanted to do more fine grain analysis and say you know how far into the words is the all that you could do that it's just 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1255	2563.7	2564.17	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah just do that it's just it'll just require 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1254	2563.64	2565.45	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah just do that it's just it'll just require more 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1256	2564.74	2566.85	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	just of huge it'll just require more 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1257	2566.26	2567.24	F	PhD	s	-1	0	of huge what's interesting 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1258	2567.75	2572.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	what's interesting is is exactly what times um been discussing with them too about this she 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1259	2568.41	2568.79	A	PhD	b	-1	0	is is exactly what 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1260	2572.42	2578.29	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah it's it's nice to know and also she um indicated that that yeah that's very important for overlapping houses 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1261	2577.44	2578.78	A	PhD	s^aa.x|s	-1	0	yeah it's it's nice to know and also for overlapping houses 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1262	2577.5	2577.66	F	PhD	b.x	-1	0	yeah it's it's for overlapping houses 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1263	2578.78	2583.48	A	PhD	s.x	-1	0	nice to know and also i think as a human like i don't always hear these in the actual order that they occur so i can have 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1264	2583.48	2586.16	A	PhD	s	-1	0	they occur so i can have two foreground speakers you know more again and and 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1265	2586.16	2590.57	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you know more again and and um adamant jane could all be talking and i can align 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1266	2590.57	2593.79	A	PhD	s	-1	0	be talking and i can align each of them to be starting their audience at the correct time and then look 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1267	2593.79	2595.54	A	PhD	s	-1	0	at the correct time and then look where they are relative to each other and that's not 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1268	2595.54	2597.02	A	PhD	s	-1	0	to each other and that's not really what i heard and that's another thing 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1269	2597.31	2598.48	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because it's just hard and that's another thing she said this is this is 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1270	2598.47	2599.78	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because it's just hard to do she said this is this is whatever's divers 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1271	2598.48	2600.84	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because it's just hard to do she said this is this is whatever's divers effect 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1273	2601.34	2601.96	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah when where 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1272	2601.14	2607.2	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah it's sort of yeah you sort when where and so i stuck linguistics of these experiments or people have perceptual bias as to what they hear that 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1274	2602.03	2602.45	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	it's sort of and so 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1276	2607.65	2611.61	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah you sort of move things around until you get to a low information poignant then you that not the best 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1275	2607.37	2610.03	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	yeah you sort of move things around until you get to a low information that not the best 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1277	2611.61	2613.26	A	PhD	s	-1	0	poignant then you can bring in the other person so it's 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1278	2613.26	2617.87	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's actually not even possible i think for any person to listen to a mixed signal even 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1279	2618.06	2620.95	A	PhD	s	-1	0	equalize and make sure that they have all the words in the right order 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1281	2621.83	2624.33	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i guess we'll try to write this year's speech paper i mean we will ride super 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1280	2621.34	2621.68	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	i guess 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1282	2622.35	2622.82	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	we'll try to super 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1283	2624.33	2625.21	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean we will ride it whether they accept it 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1284	2625.21	2627.71	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	it whether they accept it later or not i don't know 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1285	2628.5	2637.01	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and the good thing is that we have it's sort of the beginning of what don can use to link to preside like features from each file to each other yeah that's

Bmr019.B.dialogueact1456	2840.55	2845.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but um one reason to have you know it because i think it's sort of an open question we don't know the answer to people always say very

Bmr019.A.dialogueact1677	3169.9	3170.38	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah and go back and fix them 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1676	3169.67	3170.73	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah and go back and fix them 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1679	3171.04	3180.63	A	PhD	s	+1	1	that there are some cases like where the the wrong speaker these kids not a lot but where the uh the wrong person that the speeches drip attach the wrong speaker and you can tell 
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1678	3171.01	3171.12	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	that there are some cases 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1680	3180.62	3182.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	speaker and you can tell that when you run it or at least 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1681	3182.75	3184.68	A	PhD	s	-1	0	or at least you can get clues to it so these i guess 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1682	3182.85	3183.21	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	or at least you can get clues 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1684	3184.79	3189.12	A	PhD	s	-1	0	to it so these are from the early transcription of the people that on the mixing know like what you i guess it does also raises the possibility of 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1683	3184.75	3185.58	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	to it so these are from the early transcription i guess it does 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1685	3186.92	3187.15	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	of the people that on the mixing know 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1686	3188.37	3195.95	C	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	like what you also raises the possibility of um using that kind of representation mean i don't know this would be so we want to check but maybe using that represent presentation for data entry and 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1687	3195.95	3198.51	C	Postdoc	s^cs^e	-1	0	for data entry and then displaying it on channel eyes that representation because it i think 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1688	3198.51	3205.69	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because it i think that the main my my preference in terms of like looking at the days to see it in this kind of musical score format 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1689	3206.18	3206.49	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and also 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1690	3206.27	3208.59	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah and also is preference as well and 
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1691	3208.77	3210.07	A	PhD	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	yeah if you can get it too as well and and but i mean this if this 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1692	3209.03	3209.65	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	if you can get it too and but 
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1693	3209.92	3217.36	C	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	if you can get it too and but i mean this if this is a better interface for making these kinds of uh you know close local changes uh i'd be trying to i don't i have no
