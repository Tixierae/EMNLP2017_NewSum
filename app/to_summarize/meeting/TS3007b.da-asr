TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	580.8	584.15	C	ID	el.ass	+1	1	Do you use that sure one button for multiple functions like example pressing

TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	631.9	632.4	C	ID	stl	-1	0	well uh what i did was 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	632.4	636.24	C	ID	inf	+1	1	uh what i did was i the second uh the current remote controls and um 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	636.24	639.56	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and um i reviewed all how they would that's how they work 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	639.56	640.47	C	ID	inf	-1	0	how they work uh what 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	640.47	643.2	C	ID	inf	+1	1	uh what kind of components are involved and 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	643.2	646.46	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and how there are connected together and 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	646.46	653.04	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and uh after that i put of the scheme about how uh uh these things are all the nice i'll show it to 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	653.04	656.02	C	ID	off	+1	1	i'll show it to you in an uh a few seconds and i'll explain and it's 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	656.02	658.59	C	ID	off	+1	1	and i'll explain and it's about uh how it works and 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	658.59	662.4	C	ID	off	-1	0	it works and how we could uh um build on and why 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	662.4	668.18	C	ID	off	-1	0	on and why i think several possibilities uh but we discuss uh uh the meeting falls off Yeah 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	668.85	671.3	C	ID	stl	-1	0	Yeah right Uh well what i did was 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	671.3	673.77	C	ID	inf	+1	1	what i did was uh i'd i'd check their remote controls and 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	673.77	677.16	C	ID	inf	+1	1	remote controls and d. uh remote controls are they are all infrared uh michael probably 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	677.16	678.89	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh michael probably no and 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	678.89	686.3	C	ID	inf	+1	1	no and the thing about that is um the remote controls i have to access t. v. or uh uh a c. area or something and does 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	686.3	688.94	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and does uh i have a transmitter that's 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	688.94	690.72	C	ID	inf	+1	1	transmitter that's also focus on the infra-red so if 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	690.72	701.17	C	ID	inf	+1	1	on the infra-red so if we want to uh build uh it and uh remote control or with bluetooth for instance then uh the t. v. should have bluetooth to in order to communicate so that would mean 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	701.17	703.72	C	ID	inf	+1	1	so that would mean extra cost for the user and this 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	703.72	705.53	C	ID	fra	-1	0	and this it uh that's that would 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	705.53	708.84	C	ID	ass	-1	0	that would mean uh a cheap uh remote control for us 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	709.29	714.1	C	ID	inf	+1	1	So that's probably why most controls are still inside and furthermore i'll have 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	714.1	716.58	C	ID	inf	+1	1	furthermore i'll have a very simple structure so that 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	716.58	720.6	C	ID	inf	-1	0	structure so that would probably uh mean lower cost and uh 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	720.6	721.48	C	ID	stl	-1	0	cost and uh yeah that could 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	721.48	721.61	C	ID	fra	-1	0	yeah that could 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	721.61	724.11	C	ID	ass	-1	0	yeah that could mean for us a good thing "'cause" uh 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	724.11	732.58	C	ID	inf	+1	1	"'cause" uh well we we should be able to will the relative to be cheap the cheap the cheap the remote well uh 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	732.58	733.19	C	ID	stl	-1	0	well uh as i mentioned that the 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	733.19	734.89	C	ID	fra	-1	0	as i mentioned that the way some good if well 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	734.89	735.15	C	ID	stl	-1	0	way some good if well it may be possible but 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	735.15	735.99	C	ID	ass	-1	0	it may be possible but 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	735.99	740.6	C	ID	ass	-1	0	it may be possible but um i figured it wouldn't be possible in within a budget but that's 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	740.6	742.02	C	ID	off	-1	0	budget but that's not for me to decide but that's maybe something 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	742.02	744.41	C	ID	sug	-1	0	but that's maybe something for marketing to look into 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	744.41	745.16	C	ID	fra	-1	0	into "'cause" uh well my 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	745.16	752.46	C	ID	sug	+1	1	"'cause" uh well my personal opinion is to is not to do a beautiful for uh all Or radio waves although

TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	753.45	763.11	D	ME	el.ass	+1	1	What do you think about uh incorporating bluetooth or uh radio uh receiver uh in the place all the next to the t. v. connected to the t. v. 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	763.48	763.79	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Yeah i actually 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	763.79	764.64	C	ID	fra	-1	0	Yeah i actually i have 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	764.33	765.63	D	ME	inf	-1	0	So it's an hour um product 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	766.25	766.97	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Yeah actually 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	766.97	770.33	C	ID	ass	+1	1	Yeah actually if you get that would be that would be rather nice but then you still 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	770.33	773.95	C	ID	inf	+1	1	but then you still have to uh infrared function so 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	773.95	777.89	C	ID	ass	-1	0	so and and see you did actually just moved a problem but 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	774.06	774.36	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	777.18	777.37	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	777.89	787.03	C	ID	sug	+1	1	but uh what i did uh uh think about was when you mentioned about the the cup folder is one of the uh introduce a speech function for like where is the remote if somebody says where is the remote 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	787.03	790.71	C	ID	sug	+1	1	if somebody says where is the remote then it goes beep the beep beep beep or something i dunno

TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	791.22	793.25	C	ID	ass	+1	1	maybe yeah maybe something to look into i don't know uh what 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	793.25	796.19	C	ID	inf	+1	1	i don't know uh what cost from that something like that could be but it may be uh 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	796.19	799.17	C	ID	ass	-1	0	but it may be uh maybe something to explore uh yeah i'll 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	799.17	802.46	C	ID	off	+1	1	uh yeah i'll i'll just explain a bit of the components uh at first 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	802.46	804.15	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh at first you have the energy source of energy source will be 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	804.15	806.93	C	ID	sug	+1	1	of energy source will be uh battery simple uh battery that 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	806.93	808.51	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh battery that you could find anywhere i figured that 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	808.51	809.83	C	ID	ass	+1	1	i figured that would be best "'cause" 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	809.83	815.71	C	ID	inf	-1	0	would be best "'cause" when the battery uh stop functioning uh uh we could just they use could just go out and buy new one 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	816.05	821.43	C	ID	sug	-1	0	So we did and then we don't have to do all uh huh to be too complicated about that uh the energy 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	821.43	824.8	C	ID	inf	+1	1	uh the energy source is connected to the infra-red button but 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	824.8	832.31	C	ID	inf	+1	1	but uh the infrared that button uh it works only find a chip and the subcomponent do uh the switch there is a switch 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	832.31	834.38	C	ID	inf	-1	0	there is a switch it between each when it's which is pressed 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	834.38	836.25	C	ID	fra	-1	0	when it's which is pressed in the work on this this case is which is 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	836.25	837.6	C	ID	inf	-1	0	this this case is which is a button when a button 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	837.6	841.79	C	ID	inf	+1	1	a button when a button as brutal pushed in uh like the current go through here and 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	841.79	845.46	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and in uh immediate real a bold lights up for uh displaying to 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	845.46	848.56	C	ID	inf	+1	1	uh displaying to use it that's something has happened there's other 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	848.56	854.4	C	ID	inf	+1	1	there's other side uh user won't be uh thinking what what did the button be press on what happened uh well i press a 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	854.4	855.28	C	ID	inf	-1	0	well i press a button but nothing's happening 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	855.28	856.66	C	ID	inf	-1	0	button but nothing's happening on the t. v. so is

TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	888.32	892.46	C	ID	sug	+1	1	what we have to keep it simple not too many uh get chips and functions is like you said 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	892.46	893.21	C	ID	inf	-1	0	is like you said there were 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	893.21	894.03	C	ID	stl	-1	0	there were the most users 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	894.03	895.52	C	ID	fra	-1	0	the most users will you have a lot 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	895.52	896.53	C	ID	inf	-1	0	will you have a lot of buttons and you used 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	896.53	898.31	C	ID	inf	-1	0	of buttons and you used to you don't use them so why 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	898.31	902.92	C	ID	sug	-1	0	them so why what should we inventor oh we'll spend more time on north 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	903.46	910.3	C	ID	sug	+1	1	Uh i i think we should stick by with infrared than spending and um no deceiving so uh and 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	910.3	911.27	C	ID	stl	-1	0	so uh and no uh input 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	911.27	913.3	C	ID	sug	-1	0	no uh input from the television so i think 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	913.3	913.8	C	ID	stl	-1	0	so i think 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	913.8	920.63	C	ID	sug	+1	1	so i think if we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and things like that because when 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	920.63	926.05	C	ID	inf	+1	1	because when you uh one teletext on the info that you'd have to build another see the two and so in order

TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	926.73	931.17	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and so in order to receive the signal from uh what's on t. v. and such so i see that could

TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	1038.9	1050.73	B	UI	sug	+1	1	so if you um going to design uh remotes that looks good it's it shouldn't away over the uh if it's possible to make of course but also the user-friendliness so uh 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	1050.73	1053.96	B	UI	inf	-1	0	so uh that's uh some of the main points And

TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	1269.6	1276.87	B	UI	sug	+1	1	the t. v. and the ones um use combination of of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times or five seconds is 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	1269.71	1269.92	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	1276.87	1279.05	B	UI	ass	+1	1	or five seconds is too complicated for most users

TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.143	1279.17	1279.41	C	ID	stl	-1	0	Yeah but 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	1279.41	1279.628	C	ID	fra	-1	0	Yeah but 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	1279.09	1279.99	D	ME	ass	-1	0	I think so too robust 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	1279.99	1281.3	D	ME	fra	-1	0	I think so too robust And that's partly 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	1281.3	1287.67	D	ME	inf	-1	0	And that's partly because uh um uh a lot of t. v.s have different menus and when 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	1287.67	1298.3	D	ME	inf	+1	1	and when you have a particular menu uh at at your device uh it could be that Don't correspond to the menu what's actually on t. v. 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	1298.29	1299.77	B	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah uh will be a problem 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.145	1300.19	1300.46	C	ID	stl	-1	0	Well you mean you have 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.125	1299.86	1300.09	D	ME	ass	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.146	1300.46	1306.66	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Well you mean you have to a rat to keep in mind that uh several t. v.s that don't even have a menu structure or they have 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	1306.66	1308.73	C	ID	inf	-1	0	structure or they have a very simple menu structure so you 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	1308.73	1308.94	C	ID	stl	-1	0	structure so you 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.149	1308.94	1312.35	C	ID	fra	+1	1	structure so you have to keep in mind that not all are uh not our remote won't 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	1312.35	1315.67	C	ID	inf	+1	1	our remote won't be able to work on all televisions and that would 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	1315.3	1315.82	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Yes 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	1315.67	1318.28	C	ID	ass	-1	0	and that would be uh a possible problem 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	1316.96	1317.45	B	UI	stl	-1	0	So if 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	1317.45	1331.7	B	UI	sug	-1	0	if we have to stick with going technologies and uh Um Well we have a restrictions of what's it's on the market today um you should keep its ideas use 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	1328.6	1328.98	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	1331.7	1334.86	B	UI	sug	-1	0	use big clear buttons not too many 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	1336.07	1338.71	B	UI	inf	-1	0	So maybe we'll lose a few option a option but i think 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	1338.71	1342.11	B	UI	ass	-1	0	a option but i think this is more important um 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	1344.24	1352.73	B	UI	sug	+1	1	Especially the important buttons and if you want to switch channels change your volume uh use teletext it it has to work at once and 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	1352.73	1360.7	B	UI	sug	+1	1	work at once and more advanced options maybe put it's somewhere away on remotes behind uh a little uh little thing or not screen 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.153	1354.78	1355.25	C	ID	fra	-1	0	And then 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	1357.75	1358.03	C	ID	stl	-1	0	Yeah but then we something like a 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	1358.03	1362.25	C	ID	sug	+1	1	but then we something like a touchscreen couldn't could make more menu up pop up or something 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	1361.83	1362.39	B	UI	stl	-1	0	And yeah if you wants 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	1362.39	1369.01	B	UI	sug	-1	0	yeah if you wants to it as puts t. v. on standby or change channels should always be possible to not force change menu 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	1369.01	1373.06	B	UI	sug	-1	0	not force change menu options or switch something um well yeah 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	1370.92	1371.17	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	1373.06	1374.13	B	UI	stl	-1	0	um well yeah if you already told 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	1374.13	1376.68	B	UI	sug	-1	0	if you already told give some feedback if the user 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	1376.68	1384.56	B	UI	sug	+1	1	if the user is pushing a button you should know if television or in the at least remote reacting and not just the the batteries maybe no 
TS3007b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	1376.25	1376.56	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	1385.24	1387.71	B	UI	stl	-1	0	And um well my conclusion 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	1387.71	1390.56	B	UI	inf	-1	0	my conclusion is it is uh less is more keep it simple 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	1390.56	1392.04	B	UI	sug	-1	0	is more keep it simple so um maybe 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	1392.04	1392.71	B	UI	stl	-1	0	so um maybe 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	1392.71	1398.6	B	UI	sug	+1	1	so um maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to where uh to keep it accessible want 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	1398.6	1399.05	B	UI	fra	-1	0	want because you're all know 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	1399.05	1403.28	B	UI	inf	-1	0	because you're all know if there are a lot of functionally on the the television some you 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	1403.28	1405.36	B	UI	inf	-1	0	some you you will never know uh and never 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	1405.36	1407.22	B	UI	inf	-1	0	uh and never use and therefore it's 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	1407.22	1409.24	B	UI	ass	-1	0	and therefore it's uh importance if you want 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	1407.25	1407.41	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	1409.24	1415.06	B	UI	sug	-1	0	if you want to change the volume or the channel but there's always accessible an e. c. and other functions 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	1415.06	1421.58	B	UI	sug	-1	0	and other functions um i'm not so important and well you you should consider just not using them or at least 
TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	1421.58	1428.72	B	UI	sug	-1	0	them or at least put again somewhere on the remote where you're not in a way for the for the most important function 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	1429.07	1430.62	D	ME	stl	-1	0	Yeah uh i i think 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	1430.62	1437.92	D	ME	ass	+1	1	i i think the idea about uh touch screen Um is very good um 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	1437.92	1450.27	D	ME	inf	+1	1	um Because recently uh i saw a news item on t. v. um about And new telephones uh for older people and they have 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	1450.27	1461.15	D	ME	inf	+1	1	and they have like uh the touch screen with a really big pictures on or like uh Uh cold uh hang up um 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	1461.15	1466.51	D	ME	ass	-1	0	um And that's uh big at advantage i think because 
TS3007b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	1466.51	1480.12	D	ME	sug	+1	1	because On one and uh uh You make the remote control compatible for older users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something it's the

TS3007b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	1492.1	1495.16	B	UI	sug	-1	0	um keep the primary buttons visible and make a remote that
