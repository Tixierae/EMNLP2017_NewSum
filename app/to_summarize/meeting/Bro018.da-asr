Bro018.C.dialogueact89	210.15	222.529	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	so if you just you just had to pick two features to turn voice invoice you pick something about the spectrum like uh our one over our zero um and our zero

Bro018.D.dialogueact102	240.29	246.68	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but about we seen um boy that everything is deceiving hadn't learned as soon 
Bro018.C.dialogueact103	241.807	242.057	C	Professor	b	-1	0	um boy that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact104	246.95	247.85	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	but um as soon not quite 
Bro018.D.dialogueact105	247.608	248.688	D	PhD	s	-1	0	um right not quite the 
Bro018.C.dialogueact106	249.08	263.04	C	Professor	fg|s^bk.%--	-1	0	but it seems to me that what you were what you were getting at before was that there is something about the difference between the original thing or there's no fifty and let the filter which is what and the variance this one 
Bro018.C.dialogueact107	263.04	265.13	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and the variance this one take on it yeah i use these 
Bro018.D.dialogueact108	265.02	265.15	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	i use these 
Bro018.D.dialogueact109	265.15	266.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i use these 
Bro018.C.dialogueact110	267.116	267.356	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	right but it it could 
Bro018.C.dialogueact111	267.356	268.536	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	right but it it could be something else suppose 
Bro018.C.dialogueact112	268.656	270.556	C	Professor	s^df^rt	-1	0	be something else suppose you didn't have anything like that then in that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact113	270.666	274.546	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	like that then in that case if you have two and that's 
Bro018.C.dialogueact114	276.71	280.97	C	Professor	s^f|s.%-	-1	0	right and this one has three outputs and this one has 
Bro018.D.dialogueact115	279.85	280.21	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	and this one has 
Bro018.C.dialogueact116	281.73	282.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	whatever fifty six or something 
Bro018.C.dialogueact117	282.11	283.47	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	fifty six or something 
Bro018.D.dialogueact118	283.782	284.192	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	if you were 
Bro018.C.dialogueact119	284.6	294.08	C	Professor	s	-1	0	if you were to sum up the probabilities for the voice to for the but the silence here we found in the past she would do better send voice sounds silence you do this one 
Bro018.C.dialogueact120	295.43	299.33	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so just having the three output thing doesn't doesn't really buy anything 
Bro018.C.dialogueact122	300.18	301.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	the issue is what you feed it 
Bro018.D.dialogueact121	299.79	299.98	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.D.dialogueact123	303.74	303.85	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah i 
Bro018.D.dialogueact124	303.85	304.42	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i stuff yeah 
Bro018.D.dialogueact125	304.87	305.11	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	stuff yeah 
Bro018.C.dialogueact126	306.28	307.14	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	so uh so you're saying take the features 
Bro018.D.dialogueact128	307.085	307.275	D	PhD	s^ar.%--	-1	0	take the features 
Bro018.E.dialogueact127	306.75	315.05	E	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	so uh well that's another way that was what i was saying so you're saying take the features that go into the voice voice silence net and feed those into together has additional into it's rather than having a separate 
Bro018.C.dialogueact129	312.5	315.34	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well that's another way that was what i was saying has additional into it's rather than having a separate 
Bro018.D.dialogueact130	314.26	314.53	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	well that's another than having a separate 
Bro018.C.dialogueact131	315.34	316.15	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	way that was what i was saying but yeah that's certainly 
Bro018.C.dialogueact132	316.15	318.33	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	but yeah that's certainly another thing to do i was just trying 
Bro018.C.dialogueact133	318.58	324.34	C	Professor	qo	-1	0	to do i was just trying to say if you if you bring this into the picture over this what mortices by 
Bro018.E.dialogueact134	324.71	325.06	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and when i was saying 
Bro018.C.dialogueact135	325.29	333.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and when i was saying is that the only thing i think that it buys you is um based on whether you think it's something different 
Bro018.C.dialogueact136	334.95	336.71	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and something different some fundamental way and so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact137	336.71	360.81	C	Professor	s	-1	0	way and so that kind of thing that that she was talking about before was looking at something about um something uh about the difference between the thee uh um well i fifty uh of power yeah and they bought gratitude uh if a spectrum uh and the um uh filter back 
Bro018.D.dialogueact138	361.38	361.52	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact139	362.5	368.81	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	and so the filter bank is chosen in fact to sort of integrate out the sex bitch 
Bro018.C.dialogueact140	369.36	370.14	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and she saying you know trying to soak 
Bro018.C.dialogueact141	370.14	370.76	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	you know trying to soak 
Bro018.C.dialogueact142	370.76	375.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know trying to soak the particular measure that you chose was the variance assessment of this difference but 
Bro018.C.dialogueact144	376.05	377.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that might not be the right number 
Bro018.D.dialogueact143	375.641	375.971	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but 
Bro018.D.dialogueact145	378.68	378.88	D	PhD	s^am	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact146	379.3	379.68	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right i mean maybe 
Bro018.C.dialogueact147	379.68	383.08	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	right i mean maybe there's something about the variance that's that's not enough for maybe there's something else 
Bro018.C.dialogueact148	383.08	385.36	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	maybe there's something else that that one could use but 
Bro018.C.dialogueact149	385.36	391.821	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but i think that for me the thing that that struck me was that uh you want to get something back here so here's 
Bro018.C.dialogueact150	391.821	392.991	C	Professor	s	-1	0	back here so here's here's an idea 
Bro018.C.dialogueact151	393.81	400.69	C	Professor	qw^cs	-1	0	uh what about if you skip all the all the really clever things and just that uh log onto spectrum into 
Bro018.D.dialogueact152	404.05	404.68	D	PhD	s^br	-1	0	sorry 
Bro018.C.dialogueact153	405.72	406.39	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	this is you have a large 
Bro018.C.dialogueact154	406.49	412.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you have a large bank of spectrum and you were looking at that and the difference in the filter bank and and computing variance 
Bro018.D.dialogueact155	407.558	407.818	D	PhD	b	-1	0	bank of spectrum 
Bro018.D.dialogueact156	408.178	408.518	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and you were looking at 
Bro018.C.dialogueact158	413.09	414.16	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that's clever thing to do what if you stop being clever 
Bro018.D.dialogueact157	412.698	413.048	D	PhD	b	-1	0	variance that's clever thing to do 
Bro018.C.dialogueact159	414.16	415.41	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	what if you stop being clever 
Bro018.C.dialogueact161	416.42	421.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and you just took this thing in here because this in their own that's in their own that's are wonderful and figure 
Bro018.D.dialogueact160	416.279	416.599	D	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	and you just took 
Bro018.C.dialogueact162	421.11	427.291	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and figure out what they can but they put most needs and things and yeah it's that good at 
Bro018.D.dialogueact163	425.49	425.69	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro018.C.dialogueact164	428.742	433.902	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so i mean you're you're you're trying to be clever and say what's the statistics that should we should get about this difference 
Bro018.C.dialogueact165	434.662	440.501	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but uh in fact you know maybe just feeding this and or or feeding both of the men 
Bro018.E.dialogueact166	438.055	438.295	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and or 
Bro018.C.dialogueact167	441.697	445.487	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	yeah another way saying that it figure out what's what's is the interaction especially if 
Bro018.C.dialogueact168	445.487	447.587	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	especially if you do this over multiple frames 
Bro018.D.dialogueact169	447.91	448.25	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	then you have 
Bro018.C.dialogueact170	448.75	452.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	then you have this over time and and both kinds of measures and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact171	452.88	455.94	C	Professor	s	-1	0	of measures and uh you might get something better 
Bro018.D.dialogueact172	457.58	457.89	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact173	458.57	459.26	C	Professor	h	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.E.dialogueact174	460.05	462.74	E	PhD	s	-1	0	so so don't uh don't do the division but less 
Bro018.E.dialogueact175	462.74	464.66	E	PhD	s	-1	0	the division but less than that have everything 
Bro018.C.dialogueact176	465.01	466.1	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that's another thing you could do yeah 
Bro018.C.dialogueact177	466.1	466.4	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro018.C.dialogueact178	466.96	467.22	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro018.D.dialogueact179	466.97	467.28	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro018.C.dialogueact180	468.4	469.02	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact181	471.166	476.276	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it seems to me if you have exactly the right thing that it's better to do it without the net because otherwise 
Bro018.C.dialogueact182	476.276	478.646	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because otherwise you're asking than that to learn this you know to 
Bro018.C.dialogueact183	478.646	481.246	C	Professor	s	-1	0	to learn this you know to say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication 
Bro018.E.dialogueact184	481.419	481.969	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact185	482.17	486.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean you could feed a bunches you could see two numbers that you wanted multiply into in that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact186	487.66	489.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and have a bunch of nominee areas in the middle and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact187	489.87	492.99	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	in the middle and train it to get the product of the output and work 
Bro018.C.dialogueact188	493.71	494.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's kind of crazy because we 
Bro018.C.dialogueact189	494.72	495.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it's kind of crazy because we know how to multiply and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact190	495.8	501.08	C	Professor	s	-1	0	know how to multiply and you'd be you'd be you know much lower air usually just multiply that but suppose 
Bro018.C.dialogueact191	501.457	503.807	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but suppose you don't really know what the right thing and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact192	504.397	508.497	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and that's what these sort of dumb machine i mean learning it's a good at so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact193	508.727	508.807	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	a good at so

Bro018.C.dialogueact371	880.757	882.527	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well maybe something will think of something but this is 
Bro018.E.dialogueact370	880.289	880.699	E	PhD	b	-1	0	well 
Bro018.C.dialogueact372	882.607	883.407	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	of something but this is uh 
Bro018.C.dialogueact373	885.04	888.58	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	may just be that they they want to have some for very small energies they want to 
Bro018.C.dialogueact374	888.58	891.04	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	they want to have some yeah that that that that they 
Bro018.D.dialogueact375	890.01	894.42	D	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	that that that that they don't i can understand that's a tough these no because he's 
Bro018.D.dialogueact376	894.42	894.63	D	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	these no because he's 
Bro018.D.dialogueact377	894.63	898.036	D	PhD	s	-1	0	well it's it's it's these no because he's too to do something like that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact379	898.45	907.338	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well it's it's it's it's interesting natural log it says that when when you get down to essentially zero energy is going to be natural of one which is zero so 
Bro018.D.dialogueact378	898.346	898.616	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	well it's it's it's 
Bro018.D.dialogueact380	903.94	904.25	D	PhD	b	-1	0	is going to be natural 
Bro018.C.dialogueact381	907.948	913.81	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so it will go down to the natural log being 
Bro018.C.dialogueact382	914.74	916.28	C	Professor	s	-1	0	because i always value for this will be zero so it through 
Bro018.C.dialogueact383	916.28	918.41	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so it through restricted to being positive and the 
Bro018.C.dialogueact384	918.78	920.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and the service most very small energies 
Bro018.C.dialogueact385	921.666	925.526	C	Professor	s^am^cs	-1	0	um why they chose sixty four and something else i was probably just experimental 
Bro018.C.dialogueact387	926.258	929.138	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	and the the the cost in front of it i have no idea 
Bro018.D.dialogueact386	925.96	926.2	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and the the 
Bro018.C.dialogueact388	929.77	930.08	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	right i.

Bro018.C.dialogueact391	938.186	949.079	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	they they probably have something to clear six point arithmetic that they're using and then it just maybe day says hard i am basis of these i was just going to say maybe it has something to do

Bro018.C.dialogueact396	951.332	951.522	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	yeah they were doing 
Bro018.E.dialogueact395	950.94	951.67	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	yeah with hardware something they were doing

Bro018.C.dialogueact398	952.5	955.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it that there's probably working six point range or something i think are supposed

Bro018.C.dialogueact440	1049.08	1053.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean i mostly just ignore it because i was too busy and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact441	1054.19	1055.06	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so uh 
Bro018.C.dialogueact442	1056.15	1058.32	C	Professor	qy^rt^t^tc	+1	1	oh won't talk little bit about what we're talking about this morning briefly 
Bro018.A.dialogueact443	1058.52	1058.74	A	Grad	s^bk^fe	-1	0	oh briefly 
Bro018.A.dialogueact445	1058.98	1061.3	A	Grad	fh|s^aa	-1	0	oh um but uh yeah so i briefly 
Bro018.C.dialogueact444	1058.56	1061.08	C	Professor	qr^rt	-1	0	oh um but uh yeah so i briefly 
Bro018.A.dialogueact446	1061.3	1068.48	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah so i i guess some of the progress i i've been getting uh getting my committee members farther calls 
Bro018.A.dialogueact447	1069.13	1073.93	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and um so far more again and you know it mike jordan 
Bro018.A.dialogueact448	1074.19	1076.11	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and that's john hollings agreed yeah cool 
Bro018.A.dialogueact450	1076.92	1077.8	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah yeah so cool 
Bro018.E.dialogueact449	1076.62	1076.94	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	yeah cool 
Bro018.A.dialogueact451	1077.96	1081.0	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah so um i i just need ask um now like 
Bro018.A.dialogueact452	1081.46	1081.69	A	Grad	s	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.A.dialogueact453	1082.16	1083.38	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um then uh 
Bro018.A.dialogueact454	1083.59	1091.11	A	Grad	s	+1	1	then uh talked a little bit about um continuing with these dynamic even um acoustic events and 
Bro018.A.dialogueact455	1091.66	1104.88	A	Grad	s	+1	1	and um we're we're we're thinking about oh wait to test the complete this of like a set of um dynamic uh events 
Bro018.A.dialogueact456	1105.45	1122.79	A	Grad	qo	+1	1	a complete this in the in the sense that um if we if we take these x. number of acoustic events do they provide sufficient coverage for uh the phones that we're trying to recognize or or the the words that were going to try to recognize her on 
Bro018.A.dialogueact457	1123.44	1139.65	A	Grad	s	+1	1	and some morgan hours uh discussing um uh form of cheating experiment where we get um we have uh i chosen set of features are acoustic events 
Bro018.A.dialogueact458	1140.1	1146.28	A	Grad	s	+1	1	and we train up a hybrid um system to do phone recognition on ten tennis 
Bro018.A.dialogueact459	1146.99	1163.19	A	Grad	s	-1	0	tennis so if the ideas if we get good phone recognition results using um the set of acoustic events then um that that says that these greasy events argh sufficient to cover the phones at least found intended 
Bro018.A.dialogueact460	1163.3	1164.4	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	at least found intended 
Bro018.A.dialogueact461	1165.06	1173.5	A	Grad	qo	-1	0	um so it would be a a measure of are we on the right track with with uh the choices of our acoustic events 
Bro018.A.dialogueact462	1174.17	1176.45	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um so that's going on and 
Bro018.A.dialogueact463	1176.76	1183.95	A	Grad	s	-1	0	on and uh so just uh working on my uh final project for jordan's class uh 
Bro018.A.dialogueact464	1183.95	1184.88	A	Grad	s^e.%-	-1	0	class uh which is 
Bro018.C.dialogueact465	1185.31	1185.85	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	actually i mean well 
Bro018.A.dialogueact467	1186.03	1186.21	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay that sounds like my backup 
Bro018.C.dialogueact466	1185.99	1186.52	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	okay actually i mean well that sounds like my backup 
Bro018.A.dialogueact469	1186.93	1187.65	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay sure that sounds like my backup or still wanted 
Bro018.C.dialogueact468	1186.52	1188.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay sure that sounds like my backup or still wanted to do same now suggesting 
Bro018.C.dialogueact470	1188.12	1196.61	C	Professor	s	-1	0	to do same now suggesting though is that given the time of binary teachers uh maybe the first thing to do is just to count 
Bro018.C.dialogueact471	1197.55	1202.59	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh calico occurrences and get probabilities for discrete h. m. m. 
Bro018.C.dialogueact472	1203.71	1204.65	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so be pretty simple because 
Bro018.C.dialogueact473	1204.65	1214.7	C	Professor	s	-1	0	simple because his safety here ten you events uh that you're county train would only have a thousand possible values for these ten bits 
Bro018.C.dialogueact474	1215.53	1222.53	C	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	and uh so you could make a table that was if few thirty nine phone categories would be a thousand by thirty nine and just count 
Bro018.C.dialogueact475	1222.53	1234.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	nine and just count the co currents isn't and them but uh uh current uh skeptical creches between the event and the phone and divide them by the number of occurrences of the phone and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact476	1234.87	1238.83	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	of the phone and that would give you the likelihood of uh of the events given the phone 
Bro018.C.dialogueact477	1239.34	1243.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and um then just use that uh in a very simple h. m. m. and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact478	1243.71	1251.88	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	m. m. and uh you could uh phone recognition man and and um wouldn't have any of the issues with uh training and then after 
Bro018.C.dialogueact479	1251.88	1254.24	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and then after i mean you'd be on the simple side but 
Bro018.C.dialogueact480	1254.24	1254.43	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	but 
Bro018.E.dialogueact481	1254.72	1255.05	E	PhD	b	-1	0	but 
Bro018.C.dialogueact482	1255.24	1256.91	C	Professor	h	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact483	1259.33	1277.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know if uh the example was given was if if you had um onset of voicing and and and the voicing as being two kinds of events then if you had to assume all mark correctly and you counted to co occurrences she get a completely right 
Bro018.E.dialogueact484	1277.88	1278.17	E	PhD	b	-1	0	right 
Bro018.C.dialogueact485	1279.28	1279.79	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact486	1280.27	1284.11	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um but you get all the other distinctions you know randomly wrong i mean it be nothing 
Bro018.C.dialogueact487	1284.21	1285.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it be nothing to tell you that so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact488	1285.94	1288.77	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	to tell you that so um 
Bro018.C.dialogueact489	1289.58	1301.61	C	Professor	s	-1	0	if you just do this by county and then you should be able to find out a pretty straightforward way whether you have a sufficient uh set of events to to through that kind of level of uh classification of phones that you like 
Bro018.C.dialogueact490	1302.89	1304.1	C	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	that was that was good in everything we were discussing 
Bro018.C.dialogueact491	1304.1	1309.81	C	Professor	qo^tc	-1	0	everything we were discussing was was um okay how do you get your training 
Bro018.E.dialogueact492	1310.22	1310.75	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact493	1311.22	1321.58	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	because um the switchboard transcription project uh uh you know was half dozen people or so working off and on over a couple of years and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact494	1321.58	1321.67	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	of years and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact495	1323.26	1327.52	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh similar similar amount of data to we're talking about within kind training so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact496	1327.52	1341.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	training so seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is uh to automatically translate the uh current timid markings into the markings you want 
Bro018.C.dialogueact497	1341.75	1351.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you won't have the kind of character signatures like of catching funny kind of things that maybe aren't they're from these automatic markings but but 
Bro018.E.dialogueact498	1348.72	1349.03	E	PhD	b	-1	0	aren't they're from these 
Bro018.C.dialogueact499	1351.19	1352.1	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	but but uh 
Bro018.C.dialogueact500	1352.1	1354.44	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh it's uh 
Bro018.E.dialogueact501	1355.04	1356.13	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	probably a good place to start 
Bro018.C.dialogueact502	1356.34	1356.75	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.E.dialogueact503	1356.75	1356.98	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact504	1357.34	1358.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	in short turnaround time just 
Bro018.C.dialogueact505	1358.95	1365.21	C	Professor	s	-1	0	turnaround time just that again just to see if that information is sufficient to uh determine their phones 
Bro018.E.dialogueact506	1359.53	1360.02	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that again just to see if that 
Bro018.E.dialogueact507	1365.26	1365.6	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact508	1366.97	1367.34	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.E.dialogueact509	1368.13	1377.12	E	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	you could even then to to get an idea about how different it is you could maybe take some subset you know go through a few sentences mark in my hand and then see how different 
Bro018.E.dialogueact510	1377.12	1381.98	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and then see how different it is economical once just 
Bro018.C.dialogueact511	1380.93	1381.22	C	Professor	b	-1	0	economical once just 
Bro018.E.dialogueact512	1381.98	1386.95	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and get little once just to get an idea rough idea if it really makes a difference 
Bro018.C.dialogueact513	1386.71	1387.94	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	and get little feeling for it though yeah makes a difference 
Bro018.C.dialogueact515	1387.94	1388.95	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	feeling for it though yeah that's probably right 
Bro018.E.dialogueact514	1387.71	1388.0	E	PhD	b	-1	0	feeling for it though yeah that's probably right 
Bro018.C.dialogueact516	1389.6	1396.74	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i i i guess would be that this is just and that's read speech that this would be less of a big deal if you 
Bro018.E.dialogueact517	1395.51	1395.99	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	of 
Bro018.C.dialogueact518	1396.85	1399.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	a big deal if you look at spontaneous speech 
Bro018.E.dialogueact519	1398.45	1398.75	E	PhD	b	-1	0	speech 
Bro018.E.dialogueact520	1399.14	1399.37	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact521	1400.27	1406.53	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and the other thing would be safe yet these ten events you'd want to see what what if you took two events before events or answers and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact522	1406.53	1407.01	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and hopefully there should be some 
Bro018.C.dialogueact523	1407.08	1414.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	hopefully there should be some point which having more information doesn't tell you really all that much more about 
Bro018.E.dialogueact524	1413.85	1414.45	E	PhD	b	-1	0	more about 
Bro018.E.dialogueact525	1417.14	1422.86	E	PhD	s.x	-1	0	you could define other events as being sequences of these events 
Bro018.C.dialogueact526	1425.12	1426.04	C	Professor	fh|s^aap^rt	-1	0	uh you could but the thing is what he's 
Bro018.C.dialogueact527	1426.04	1433.54	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but the thing is what he's talking about here is any uh the translation too a per frame feature of actor 
Bro018.C.dialogueact528	1437.54	1440.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so there's no sequence in that i think i think 
Bro018.C.dialogueact529	1440.14	1440.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i think i think 
Bro018.C.dialogueact530	1440.89	1441.84	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i think i think it's just a unless you did like 
Bro018.E.dialogueact531	1441.19	1444.39	E	PhD	s^arp.%--	-1	0	it's just a unless you did like the second passover or something you got here 
Bro018.C.dialogueact532	1445.11	1447.75	C	Professor	s^aa|s^arp^df.%-	-1	0	yeah but it's time or some simple here yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact533	1446.55	1446.78	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	simple here yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact534	1446.86	1447.07	E	PhD	b	-1	0	simple here yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact535	1447.52	1447.65	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.E.dialogueact536	1449.41	1450.29	E	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i'm adding complexity 
Bro018.C.dialogueact537	1450.61	1450.92	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bro018.C.dialogueact538	1451.19	1451.52	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	just yeah 
Bro018.C.dialogueact539	1451.77	1461.4	C	Professor	s^f|qo^bs	-1	0	just yeah the idea is that it was a very simple statistical structure could you could to uh at least verify that chose chosen teachers that sufficient 
Bro018.E.dialogueact540	1455.51	1455.8	E	PhD	b	-1	0	could you could to 
Bro018.C.dialogueact541	1470.04	1473.38	C	Professor	fg|qo^t.%--	-1	0	oh yeah it um okay you were saying something starts to something else but your class project 
Bro018.A.dialogueact542	1472.53	1472.88	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh your class project 
Bro018.A.dialogueact543	1473.3	1474.32	A	Grad	h	-1	0	yeah it um so for my class 
Bro018.C.dialogueact544	1473.78	1474.11	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah it um so for my class 
Bro018.A.dialogueact545	1474.39	1481.11	A	Grad	h|s^rt	-1	0	so for my class project i'm um tinkering with uh support wrecker machines something that we learned in 
Bro018.A.dialogueact546	1481.21	1482.59	A	Grad	s	-1	0	something that we learned in class and uh 
Bro018.A.dialogueact547	1482.59	1487.69	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	class and uh um basically just another method for doing classification 
Bro018.A.dialogueact548	1488.24	1496.13	A	Grad	s	-1	0	of um when i apply that to um compare with the results by um king and taylor who did um these um 
Bro018.A.dialogueact549	1496.53	1497.32	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um using recurring 
Bro018.A.dialogueact550	1497.32	1503.91	A	Grad	s	-1	0	using recurring on that's they recognized um aside of fun illogical features 
Bro018.A.dialogueact551	1504.4	1505.16	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um maybe 
Bro018.A.dialogueact552	1505.28	1509.41	A	Grad	s	-1	0	maybe a mapping from the and that's he sees use one illogical features so i'm going to 
Bro018.A.dialogueact553	1509.41	1513.32	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so i'm going to do a similar thing with with support factor machines 
Bro018.A.dialogueact554	1513.32	1514.29	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so what the 
Bro018.E.dialogueact555	1514.17	1517.21	E	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	um so what the advantage of support rectum machines but 
Bro018.E.dialogueact556	1517.21	1517.48	E	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	um but 
Bro018.A.dialogueact557	1518.08	1524.34	A	Grad	h|s	-1	0	so supportive victor machines are are good with dealing with uh less amount of data 
Bro018.E.dialogueact558	1524.84	1525.27	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro018.A.dialogueact559	1525.48	1533.24	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and um so if you if you give the last day that it still does a reasonable job and learning the the patterns 
Bro018.E.dialogueact560	1533.38	1533.81	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.A.dialogueact561	1534.09	1536.93	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and uh 
Bro018.C.dialogueact562	1537.3	1537.66	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i guess yeah the sort 
Bro018.C.dialogueact563	1537.66	1537.82	C	Professor	b	-1	0	i guess yeah the sort 
Bro018.C.dialogueact564	1537.82	1538.79	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i guess yeah the sort of saying 
Bro018.C.dialogueact565	1539.08	1541.12	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.A.dialogueact566	1540.05	1540.28	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.E.dialogueact567	1542.56	1546.13	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	is there's some kind of a distance metric they they use or how do they 
Bro018.E.dialogueact568	1546.13	1549.53	E	PhD	qw^g	-1	0	or how do they per class what do they do for classification 
Bro018.A.dialogueact569	1550.08	1550.75	A	Grad	h	-1	0	um right 
Bro018.A.dialogueact570	1550.75	1551.16	A	Grad	h	-1	0	um right so 
Bro018.A.dialogueact571	1551.16	1559.91	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so the the simple idea behind us perfect or machine is um you have you have this feature space right 
Bro018.A.dialogueact572	1559.91	1560.13	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	feature space right and then it 
Bro018.A.dialogueact574	1560.2	1569.66	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then it finds the optimal separating planes um between these two different um classes 
Bro018.E.dialogueact573	1559.96	1560.34	E	PhD	b	-1	0	feature space right and then it 
Bro018.E.dialogueact575	1565.68	1566.15	E	PhD	b	-1	0	um between 
Bro018.E.dialogueact576	1569.71	1570.06	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro018.A.dialogueact577	1570.33	1575.37	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um and so what 
Bro018.A.dialogueact578	1575.84	1585.12	A	Grad	s	-1	0	what it at the end of the day what actually does is it takes those examples of the features that are closest to the separating boundary and remembers 
Bro018.A.dialogueact579	1585.4	1586.5	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and remembers us and 
Bro018.E.dialogueact580	1585.41	1585.73	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and remembers 
Bro018.A.dialogueact581	1586.96	1591.56	A	Grad	s	-1	0	us and and uses them to retrace the boundary for the test set 
Bro018.A.dialogueact582	1592.06	1614.15	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so given these um these features are these these examples um critical examples which they call support support actors then um given a new example if the new example falls um away from the boundary in one direction then it's classified as being part of this particular class and otherwise 
Bro018.E.dialogueact583	1602.27	1602.6	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	then 
Bro018.A.dialogueact584	1614.56	1616.73	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and otherwise the other class so why 
Bro018.E.dialogueact585	1616.74	1618.39	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	other class so why save the samples why not just say 
Bro018.E.dialogueact586	1618.39	1621.56	E	PhD	qw^g	-1	0	why not just say what uh boundary itself is 
Bro018.A.dialogueact587	1619.67	1620.12	A	Grad	b	-1	0	what uh boundary itself 
Bro018.A.dialogueact588	1622.46	1623.83	A	Grad	h	-1	0	um 
Bro018.A.dialogueact589	1624.16	1624.64	A	Grad	h	-1	0	see 
Bro018.A.dialogueact590	1627.79	1628.47	A	Grad	h	-1	0	oh 
Bro018.A.dialogueact591	1632.63	1633.55	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	yeah that's a good question 
Bro018.A.dialogueact592	1633.85	1634.03	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	question that's another way doing it 
Bro018.A.dialogueact594	1634.62	1634.79	A	Grad	b	-1	0	that's another way doing it 
Bro018.C.dialogueact593	1634.19	1635.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that's another way doing it right so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact596	1635.61	1637.41	C	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	right so so i something like i guess it's sort of an equivalent 
Bro018.E.dialogueact595	1635.55	1635.81	E	PhD	b	-1	0	right so 
Bro018.E.dialogueact597	1637.07	1637.88	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	it's sort of an equivalent 
Bro018.C.dialogueact598	1638.78	1641.6	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know it it goes back to nearest neighbor sort of thing right um 
Bro018.E.dialogueact599	1641.04	1641.46	E	PhD	b	-1	0	sort of thing right um 
Bro018.C.dialogueact600	1641.6	1641.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	sort of thing right um 
Bro018.C.dialogueact601	1641.91	1644.96	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	sort of thing right um is is is it it 
Bro018.C.dialogueact602	1645.65	1646.9	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	when nearest neighbor goodwill 
Bro018.C.dialogueact603	1646.9	1651.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	neighbor goodwill nearest neighbor good is good if you have lots of lots of examples um 
Bro018.C.dialogueact604	1651.91	1657.74	C	Professor	s	-1	0	um but of course you have lots and lots of examples then they can take a while to to use nearest neighbor's lots 
Bro018.C.dialogueact605	1657.74	1658.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	nearest neighbor's lots what craps 
Bro018.C.dialogueact606	1659.18	1664.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so long time ago people talked about things where you would have uh condensed nearest neighbor where you would 
Bro018.C.dialogueact607	1664.63	1672.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	neighbor where you would you would you would pick out some representative examples which would uh be sufficient to represent to correct classify everything came in 
Bro018.E.dialogueact608	1665.78	1666.16	E	PhD	b	-1	0	you would you would pick out some representative 
Bro018.E.dialogueact609	1672.6	1673.04	E	PhD	b	-1	0	came in i i think 
Bro018.C.dialogueact610	1673.61	1678.17	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i i think so i think support factor stuff sort of goes back to 
Bro018.C.dialogueact612	1678.92	1679.22	C	Professor	b	-1	0	so 
Bro018.E.dialogueact611	1678.53	1679.1	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bro018.E.dialogueact613	1679.95	1685.42	E	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	so rather than doing nearest neighbor we compared to every single one you just pick a few critical ones 
Bro018.E.dialogueact614	1685.42	1685.58	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	ones 
Bro018.C.dialogueact615	1686.27	1686.53	C	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.E.dialogueact616	1686.88	1687.25	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and it that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact617	1687.45	1688.0	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and it that you know 
Bro018.C.dialogueact618	1688.55	1701.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know um during that approach uh or gus's mixtures for that matter arse for probably brute force kinds of things where you sort of you pre defined that there's this big bunch of parameters 
Bro018.C.dialogueact619	1702.04	1704.96	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then you you place and as you best can't to define the boundaries and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact620	1704.96	1708.42	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	define the boundaries and in fact is you know these things to take a lot of parameters and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact621	1708.6	1714.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and and uh if you have uh money and my son a day day you have trouble uh learning them 
Bro018.C.dialogueact622	1715.18	1722.48	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um so i i guess the idea that this is that it it is reputed to um be somewhat better in that regard 
Bro018.E.dialogueact623	1715.52	1715.77	E	PhD	b	-1	0	um so

Bro018.A.dialogueact639	1759.09	1765.2	A	Grad	s	-1	0	well basically it's it's um you you get a distance measure at the end of the day and then that distance 
Bro018.A.dialogueact640	1765.55	1770.52	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then that distance measure is is um is translated to two zero one um

Bro018.A.dialogueact647	1779.17	1779.53	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right but you 
Bro018.C.dialogueact648	1779.83	1781.58	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right you have the distance but you have to distances to work with 
Bro018.A.dialogueact649	1781.39	1782.79	A	Grad	s^aa^m	-1	0	you have the distance yeah work with because actually mississippi 
Bro018.C.dialogueact650	1782.3	1789.94	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah yeah because actually mississippi state people to use support director machines for uh uh speech recognition and they were using it to the certain probabilities 
Bro018.A.dialogueact651	1782.9	1783.12	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah because actually mississippi state people to 
Bro018.A.dialogueact652	1785.79	1786.08	A	Grad	b	-1	0	machines for uh uh speech 
Bro018.A.dialogueact653	1789.99	1801.46	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	yeah they they had uh had to wait to translate the distances into into probabilities with a with a simple um uh sick mortal function probabilities yeah and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact654	1801.67	1801.81	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact655	1801.81	1804.29	C	Professor	qr^bu	-1	0	um yeah and do they basic word or suspects type thing and then it's like 
Bro018.A.dialogueact657	1804.53	1806.77	A	Grad	h|s^aa	-1	0	um yeah there's some thing and then it's like she or something and then 
Bro018.C.dialogueact656	1804.29	1806.44	C	Professor	qy^bu^g^rt	-1	0	um yeah there's some thing and then it's like she or something and then 
Bro018.A.dialogueact659	1806.77	1810.99	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah there's some there's like one over one plus exponentially or something like that and then divide by the some of the but also so this 
Bro018.C.dialogueact658	1806.44	1808.65	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^g	-1	0	yeah there's some there's like one over one plus and then divide by the some of the

Bro018.C.dialogueact662	1810.6	1811.66	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	or something like that also so this one okay 
Bro018.A.dialogueact663	1811.69	1811.95	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	one okay 
Bro018.C.dialogueact664	1811.82	1812.07	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	one okay

Bro018.E.dialogueact666	1814.61	1817.54	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	they're did did did they get good results with that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact667	1817.84	1818.71	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	they're okay i mean i i with that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact668	1818.71	1821.17	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	okay i mean i i don't i don't think they were earth shattering but i think that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact669	1821.17	1824.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but i think that uh this is a couple years ago i remember 
Bro018.E.dialogueact670	1821.52	1821.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	but i think that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact671	1824.68	1826.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	years ago i remember them doing in some meeting and and um 
Bro018.C.dialogueact672	1826.07	1831.77	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and and um i don't think people were very critical because was interesting just to to try this and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact673	1831.77	1833.41	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	try this and it was the first time they tried it so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact674	1833.41	1836.96	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	it so so that you know the numbers were not incredibly good but 
Bro018.E.dialogueact675	1833.54	1833.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	it so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact676	1836.96	1839.54	C	Professor	s	-1	0	incredibly good but there's you know those reasonable 
Bro018.E.dialogueact677	1839.77	1840.17	E	PhD	b	-1	0	reasonable i don't remember anymore 
Bro018.C.dialogueact678	1840.35	1841.29	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i don't remember anymore i mean member 
Bro018.C.dialogueact679	1841.29	1842.75	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i mean member task was 
Bro018.C.dialogueact680	1843.07	1845.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	was broadcast news or something 
Bro018.C.dialogueact681	1845.56	1845.86	C	Professor	s^no^r	-1	0	something

Bro018.A.dialogueact683	1847.2	1847.44	A	Grad	b	-1	0	so very 
Bro018.B.dialogueact684	1847.3	1851.78	B	Grad	qw^t^tc	-1	0	so very few just have zero in ones how are you doing the speech recognition 
Bro018.A.dialogueact685	1852.21	1852.34	A	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	oh i'm not too i'm not 
Bro018.A.dialogueact686	1852.34	1855.08	A	Grad	s	-1	0	oh i'm not too i'm not planning on doing speech recognition with it i'm just doing 
Bro018.A.dialogueact687	1855.08	1858.32	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm just doing detection of foreknowledge watch cool features so 
Bro018.B.dialogueact688	1855.23	1855.45	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i'm just doing 
Bro018.A.dialogueact689	1858.81	1870.36	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so uh for example this this uh feature set called b. uh sound patterns of english um is just a bunch of um buying airy value teachers that say 
Bro018.A.dialogueact690	1870.73	1873.64	A	Grad	qo	-1	0	that say is just voicing juarez this now voicing is this 
Bro018.A.dialogueact691	1873.64	1876.24	A	Grad	qo	-1	0	voicing is this sondra and not on and stuff okay 
Bro018.A.dialogueact692	1876.24	1877.58	A	Grad	s	-1	0	stuff like that so okay did you find

Bro018.C.dialogueact708	1909.25	1911.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and and uh we were just try remember how they do but 
Bro018.C.dialogueact709	1911.84	1914.86	C	Professor	s	-1	0	remember how they do but people have used it for speech recognition they have gotten probabilities so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact710	1914.86	1919.08	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay okay gotten probabilities so they have some conversion from this distance is too

Bro018.E.dialogueact725	1928.17	1934.69	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so when you're in and the thing that you're doing uh you have a factor of ones and zeros for each phone 
Bro018.A.dialogueact727	1930.69	1930.99	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	uh 
Bro018.A.dialogueact728	1936.21	1937.65	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	uh just a class project or yeah

Bro018.A.dialogueact734	1941.51	1943.4	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	rural i right right so for every 
Bro018.A.dialogueact735	1943.4	1955.08	A	Grad	s	-1	0	right so for every phone there is there is uh um a factor of ones and zeros uh corresponding to whether it exhibits a particular one illogical feature or not uhhuh and 
Bro018.E.dialogueact736	1954.16	1954.57	E	PhD	b	-1	0	feature or not

Bro018.E.dialogueact739	1957.47	1959.97	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	well i'm what is the task for the class project 
Bro018.E.dialogueact740	1959.97	1961.97	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	the class project too talk with the phones are

Bro018.E.dialogueact742	1961.97	1966.52	E	PhD	qrr^d^g^rt	-1	0	oh right um talk with the phones are to come up with these sectors to see how close they match the phones or 
Bro018.A.dialogueact743	1963.93	1964.28	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh to see how close they 
Bro018.A.dialogueact744	1965.91	1966.34	A	Grad	h	-1	0	right um match the phones or 
Bro018.A.dialogueact745	1966.48	1981.62	A	Grad	h|s	-1	0	um to come up with day a mapping from um and that's cc's or some some features that um two uh we too whether there's existence of particular one illogical feature phones or 
Bro018.E.dialogueact746	1966.52	1966.61	E	PhD	qrr^g.%--	-1	0	um phones or

Bro018.A.dialogueact750	1984.91	1993.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah basically it's to learn a mapping from from m. cici's too um for the logical features 
Bro018.A.dialogueact751	1994.93	1996.11	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	it's the answer your question i think so 
Bro018.E.dialogueact752	1996.47	1996.94	E	PhD	s^am	-1	0	i think so 
Bro018.A.dialogueact753	1997.32	1997.56	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.A.dialogueact755	1998.51	1998.85	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	i guess 
Bro018.E.dialogueact754	1998.48	2005.03	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i guess i mean uh i'm not sure what you what you're what you get out of your system do you get out of it 
Bro018.E.dialogueact756	2005.03	2012.1	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	oh do you get out of it uh if victor of these one and zeros and then try to find the closest matching phony to that actor or 
Bro018.A.dialogueact757	2006.23	2006.49	A	Grad	b	-1	0	uh if 
Bro018.A.dialogueact759	2012.62	2013.04	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh no no i'm or

Bro018.A.dialogueact762	2017.73	2024.43	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yet just it's it's basically it's it's really simple basically a detection of phone illogical features 
Bro018.E.dialogueact763	2017.76	2018.05	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yet just it's it's basically 
Bro018.A.dialogueact765	2025.49	2025.85	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact764	2025.47	2025.9	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah

Bro018.A.dialogueact770	2035.0	2043.01	A	Grad	s	-1	0	this side of their their idea was to first find a mapping from m. s. c.'s too uh for logic features and then later on 
Bro018.E.dialogueact769	2034.61	2034.91	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and that's and 
Bro018.A.dialogueact771	2043.01	2049.83	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then later on once you have these phone illogical features then um map that to so so 
Bro018.E.dialogueact772	2047.02	2047.31	E	PhD	b	-1	0	then 
Bro018.A.dialogueact773	2050.01	2053.84	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm i'm sort of reproducing phase one of their stuff so they had one recurring

Bro018.E.dialogueact775	2052.96	2056.74	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	phase one of their stuff right so they had one recurring that for each particular feature 
Bro018.A.dialogueact776	2056.37	2056.99	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right feature 
Bro018.A.dialogueact777	2057.28	2059.13	A	Grad	b	-1	0	right right i see 
Bro018.E.dialogueact778	2057.38	2057.65	E	PhD	b	-1	0	right right i see 
Bro018.E.dialogueact779	2060.53	2064.27	E	PhD	qo	-1	0	what did they compare that i mean what if you just it's on recognition did the reverse look up 
Bro018.A.dialogueact780	2066.05	2066.6	A	Grad	h	-1	0	so you recognize 
Bro018.E.dialogueact781	2066.21	2072.41	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so you recognize the phone in whichever fun was recognize you spit out it's sector of ones and zeros 
Bro018.A.dialogueact782	2067.8	2069.03	A	Grad	b	-1	0	the phone in whichever fun was recognize you spit out it's 
Bro018.A.dialogueact785	2074.03	2074.39	A	Grad	b	-1	0	you to do that that's probably 
Bro018.C.dialogueact783	2073.88	2074.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	expect you to do that that's probably

Bro018.C.dialogueact786	2074.68	2076.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you to do that that's probably now he's going to do is class project yeah

Bro018.C.dialogueact795	2090.4	2091.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	to different that's a good question too but i was going to ask 
Bro018.C.dialogueact796	2091.35	2104.24	C	Professor	s	+1	1	too but i was going to ask about uh changes to the date uh in comparing guilty and no caps term for the sri system 
Bro018.E.dialogueact797	2105.38	2106.08	E	PhD	h	-1	0	uh 
Bro018.E.dialogueact798	2107.11	2107.85	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well what i've been 
Bro018.E.dialogueact799	2108.75	2109.7	E	PhD	s^m^t1	-1	0	changes today i'm not sure 
Bro018.E.dialogueact800	2109.7	2110.38	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	right so we today i'm not sure i'm 
Bro018.C.dialogueact801	2110.36	2110.45	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right so we i'm 
Bro018.C.dialogueact802	2110.76	2115.44	C	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	right so we talked on the phone about this that that they were still difference of a of a few percent and i'm right 
Bro018.E.dialogueact803	2112.42	2112.68	E	PhD	b	-1	0	this that that they 
Bro018.E.dialogueact804	2114.61	2114.86	E	PhD	b	-1	0	a of a few percent right 
Bro018.C.dialogueact805	2115.52	2119.68	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and you told me that there was a difference in how the normalization was done 
Bro018.C.dialogueact806	2120.14	2128.4	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and i was asking if you were going to do redo it uh for o. p. with a normalization done that should have been done for the muck cancer uh 
Bro018.E.dialogueact807	2124.3	2124.63	E	PhD	b	-1	0	uh for 
Bro018.E.dialogueact808	2129.03	2130.53	E	PhD	h|s^bk	-1	0	right no i haven't 
Bro018.E.dialogueact809	2130.53	2131.94	E	PhD	s^ar|s^df^nd	+1	1	right no i haven't had a chance to do that what 
Bro018.C.dialogueact811	2132.02	2132.33	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i've been doing is 
Bro018.E.dialogueact810	2131.94	2137.5	E	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	had a chance to do that what i've been doing is uh trying to figure out it just seems 
Bro018.E.dialogueact812	2137.5	2139.92	E	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	out it just seems to me like there's um 
Bro018.E.dialogueact813	2140.3	2141.33	E	PhD	s	+1	1	well it seems like there's about because 
Bro018.E.dialogueact814	2141.45	2146.43	E	PhD	s	+1	1	because the difference in performance is it's not gigantic but 
Bro018.E.dialogueact815	2147.01	2149.39	E	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah i it's big enough that it it seems wrong 
Bro018.C.dialogueact816	2149.84	2149.95	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah i wrong 
Bro018.C.dialogueact817	2149.95	2150.34	C	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	yeah i agree but i thought that the normalization wrong and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact819	2150.34	2154.62	C	Professor	s^ng^rt	+1	1	agree but i thought that the normalization difference was one of the absolutely sure and yeah but i don't i'm not yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact818	2150.16	2150.45	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	agree but i thought that the normalization and 
Bro018.E.dialogueact820	2153.62	2154.75	E	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	absolutely sure yeah but i don't i'm not yeah 
Bro018.C.dialogueact821	2154.62	2154.79	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	absolutely sure i don't i'm not yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact822	2154.94	2155.27	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	absolutely sure i don't i'm not yeah i guess i don't 
Bro018.E.dialogueact823	2155.33	2158.89	E	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	i guess i don't think that the normalization difference can account for everything 
Bro018.C.dialogueact825	2159.67	2159.95	C	Professor	b	-1	0	so what 
Bro018.E.dialogueact824	2159.5	2165.16	E	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	so what i was working on is um just going through and checking the header is of the wave files to see if 
Bro018.E.dialogueact826	2165.49	2172.49	E	PhD	s	-1	0	to see if maybe there was a a um a certain type of compression or something that was done that my script wasn't catching so that for 
Bro018.E.dialogueact827	2172.67	2179.4	E	PhD	s	-1	0	catching so that for some subset of the training day uh uh the uh the the features i was competing we're junk 
Bro018.C.dialogueact828	2179.91	2180.25	C	Professor	b	-1	0	junk which would you know 
Bro018.E.dialogueact829	2180.35	2183.32	E	PhD	s	-1	0	which would you know cause it to form okay but you know the 
Bro018.E.dialogueact830	2183.32	2185.17	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but you know the the models would be all messed up so i was going through 
Bro018.E.dialogueact831	2185.17	2192.47	E	PhD	s	-1	0	up so i was going through and just double checking that kind of thing first to see if there was just some kind of obvious bug in the way that i was computing features 
Bro018.C.dialogueact832	2188.38	2188.7	C	Professor	b	-1	0	to see if 
Bro018.C.dialogueact833	2189.31	2189.61	C	Professor	b	-1	0	there was just some kind 
Bro018.C.dialogueact834	2192.68	2192.9	C	Professor	b	-1	0	features 
Bro018.E.dialogueact835	2193.11	2198.18	E	PhD	s	-1	0	looking at all the sampling rates make sure all the sampling rates for what eight k. what i was assuming they were um 
Bro018.C.dialogueact836	2196.59	2196.97	C	Professor	b	-1	0	eight k. what 
Bro018.E.dialogueact837	2198.52	2199.07	E	PhD	h	-1	0	yeah that makes sense um 
Bro018.C.dialogueact838	2199.42	2200.96	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	yeah that makes sense to check all that yeah so i was 
Bro018.E.dialogueact839	2200.19	2200.37	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	to check all that yeah so i was 
Bro018.E.dialogueact840	2200.45	2204.78	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	to check all that yeah so i was doing that first before i did these other things just to make sure that wasn't something 
Bro018.C.dialogueact841	2205.1	2214.36	C	Professor	s	-1	0	although really uh it uh a couple three percent uh difference order rate uh could easily come from some difference normalization tank 
Bro018.C.dialogueact842	2215.59	2215.85	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact843	2216.06	2216.21	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	and i think 
Bro018.E.dialogueact844	2216.21	2223.81	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and i think i'm trying to remember but i think i recall that andreas was saying that he was going to run sort of the reverse experiment 
Bro018.E.dialogueact845	2224.38	2232.74	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	which is to high too emulate be normalization that we did but 
Bro018.E.dialogueact846	2232.97	2234.4	E	PhD	s	-1	0	we did but with an i'll capture features 
Bro018.E.dialogueact847	2235.94	2239.61	E	PhD	s	-1	0	sort of you know backup from the system that he had 
Bro018.E.dialogueact848	2240.15	2241.22	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	i thought he said he was going to have to look back through 
Bro018.E.dialogueact849	2241.22	2243.45	E	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah he's probably to have to look back through my my email from him 
Bro018.C.dialogueact850	2243.41	2245.97	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah he's probably off that uh that this meeting from him yeah he's gone now

Bro018.C.dialogueact864	2260.72	2267.49	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i'm i mean the other thing i wonder about was whether they were something just in uh boot strapping uh system which was based on but maybe 
Bro018.C.dialogueact865	2267.66	2268.89	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	on but maybe not since they yeah see one 
Bro018.E.dialogueact866	2268.65	2270.84	E	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	not since they yeah see one thing that's a little bit um 
Bro018.E.dialogueact867	2271.51	2276.46	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i was looking i've been studying and going through the logs for the system that um under created 
Bro018.E.dialogueact868	2277.17	2286.0	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and um his uh the way that the try system looks like it works is that it reads the wave files directly uh 
Bro018.E.dialogueact869	2286.38	2290.77	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh and does all of the castro competition stuff on the fly 
Bro018.C.dialogueact870	2287.02	2287.33	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and does 
Bro018.C.dialogueact871	2291.01	2291.3	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and 
Bro018.E.dialogueact872	2291.61	2299.48	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and so there's no place where these where they capture files are stored anywhere that can go look at and compare to kill people and so 
Bro018.E.dialogueact873	2299.47	2306.08	E	PhD	s	-1	0	people and so whereas with our features he's actually storing the kept strum on disk and he reads those in but it looked like 
Bro018.C.dialogueact874	2304.59	2304.9	C	Professor	b	-1	0	strum on disk 
Bro018.E.dialogueact875	2306.39	2309.25	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but it looked like he had to give it uh even though the cancer 
Bro018.E.dialogueact876	2309.25	2315.94	E	PhD	s	-1	0	even though the cancer is already computer has to give it uh a friend and parameter file which 
Bro018.E.dialogueact877	2316.02	2323.01	E	PhD	s	-1	0	talks about the kind of can computations that his mail capturing thing that's so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact878	2321.96	2322.31	C	Professor	b	-1	0	that his mail capturing thing that's 
Bro018.E.dialogueact879	2323.01	2327.43	E	PhD	s	-1	0	so i don't know that that probably doesn't mess up the probably just ignores 
Bro018.E.dialogueact880	2327.43	2331.83	E	PhD	s	-1	0	up the probably just ignores that if it determines that it's already in the right format or something but 
Bro018.E.dialogueact881	2331.83	2334.91	E	PhD	s	-1	0	or something but that did the two processes that happen are a little different 
Bro018.C.dialogueact883	2335.65	2335.86	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	so 
Bro018.E.dialogueact882	2335.48	2336.0	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	so the stuff they're so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact884	2336.11	2337.47	C	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	so the stuff they're of yeah yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact885	2337.2	2337.53	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	of yeah yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact886	2337.7	2337.91	E	PhD	b	-1	0	of yeah yeah 
Bro018.C.dialogueact887	2338.67	2339.11	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	so okay so back to what you thought 
Bro018.C.dialogueact888	2339.11	2339.33	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay so back to what you thought 
Bro018.C.dialogueact889	2339.33	2341.05	C	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	okay so back to what you thought i was asking yeah no and 
Bro018.E.dialogueact890	2341.46	2341.66	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah no and 
Bro018.E.dialogueact891	2341.66	2342.98	E	PhD	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	yeah no and i didn't have a chance to do that

Bro018.C.dialogueact894	2343.8	2345.38	C	Professor	s	-1	0	same answer anyway 
Bro018.E.dialogueact895	2345.81	2345.94	E	PhD	b	-1	0	anyway 
Bro018.E.dialogueact896	2347.82	2352.29	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah i've been um i've been working with um jeremy on his project and then i've been trying to 
Bro018.E.dialogueact897	2352.29	2357.45	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and then i've been trying to track down this bug that sixty friend in futures 
Bro018.C.dialogueact898	2354.71	2355.14	C	Professor	b	-1	0	that sixty 
Bro018.E.dialogueact899	2358.15	2363.02	E	PhD	s	-1	0	so one thing that i did notice yesterday i was studying the um the uh roster code and it looks 
Bro018.C.dialogueact900	2363.33	2363.67	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and it looks 
Bro018.E.dialogueact901	2363.63	2372.04	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and it looks like we don't have any way to um control the frequency range that we use in our analysis we basically 
Bro018.E.dialogueact902	2372.04	2378.14	E	PhD	s	-1	0	we basically it looks to me like we do the f. fifty um and then we just take all the bands and we use everything 
Bro018.E.dialogueact903	2378.57	2379.44	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and we use everything we don't have 
Bro018.E.dialogueact904	2379.69	2387.01	E	PhD	s:s	-1	0	we don't have any set of parameters where we can say you know only process from you know a hundred and ten hurts to thirty seven fifty 
Bro018.C.dialogueact905	2387.91	2388.32	C	Professor	h	-1	0	least i couldn't see any 
Bro018.E.dialogueact906	2388.27	2390.11	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	yeah i don't think it's in there i think least i couldn't see any kind of control for that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact907	2389.51	2390.8	C	Professor	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	yeah i don't think it's in there i think kind of control for that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact908	2390.8	2394.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	think it's in there i think it's in the uh uh the filters 
Bro018.C.dialogueact909	2395.68	2397.53	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so the s. s. t. is on everything but the filters 
Bro018.C.dialogueact910	2397.53	2398.67	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but the filters 
Bro018.C.dialogueact911	2399.57	2400.24	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um francis 
Bro018.C.dialogueact912	2400.29	2407.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	francis ignore the the lowest bands and the highest bins what 
Bro018.C.dialogueact913	2407.95	2409.81	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	what it does is it it copies the filters which 
Bro018.E.dialogueact914	2409.18	2409.94	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	copies the filters which 
Bro018.E.dialogueact915	2409.94	2410.57	E	PhD	qw^g^rt	-1	0	copies the filters which field

Bro018.C.dialogueact917	2412.76	2416.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	the filter bank which is created by integrating over a fifty bins

Bro018.C.dialogueact919	2417.67	2418.15	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	when you get the mail 
Bro018.E.dialogueact920	2418.2	2420.83	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	right yeah when you get the mail when you go to the mail skill 
Bro018.C.dialogueact921	2420.2	2420.78	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right yeah you go to the mail skill 
Bro018.C.dialogueact922	2420.78	2420.95	C	Professor	b	-1	0	right yeah you go to the mail skill 
Bro018.C.dialogueact923	2420.95	2421.77	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right yeah park scale and you go to the mail skill 
Bro018.C.dialogueact924	2421.77	2431.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	park scale and it's it it um it actually copy's the second filters over to the first of the first filters 
Bro018.C.dialogueact925	2431.45	2433.01	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	first of the first filters are always and you can see you can specify 
Bro018.C.dialogueact926	2433.01	2439.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you can see you can specify a different number of uh features different number filters i think sir 
Bro018.C.dialogueact927	2439.04	2439.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i think sir 
Bro018.C.dialogueact928	2439.88	2440.47	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i think sir call 
Bro018.C.dialogueact929	2441.66	2449.81	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you specify a different number filters and whatever uh you specify the last ones are going to be ignored so that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact930	2449.81	2454.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	to be ignored so that that's the way that you sort of change what the what the fan is this 
Bro018.C.dialogueact931	2455.8	2459.51	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you you can't do it without i think changing filters i saw something 
Bro018.C.dialogueact933	2459.56	2459.8	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	i saw something 
Bro018.E.dialogueact932	2459.54	2465.2	E	PhD	s	-1	0	yes i saw something about uh it look like it was doing something like that but i didn't quite understand it so maybe 
Bro018.E.dialogueact934	2465.2	2465.7	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yes it so maybe 
Bro018.C.dialogueact935	2465.88	2471.03	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yes the the idea that the very lowest frequencies and and typically the various ties frequencies are kind of junk it so maybe 
Bro018.E.dialogueact936	2471.24	2471.56	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact937	2472.73	2474.19	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so um you just for continuity 
Bro018.C.dialogueact938	2474.24	2480.05	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you just for continuity you just approximation by by the second highest in second abolished it's just a 
Bro018.C.dialogueact940	2480.4	2482.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it's just a simple thing we put in 
Bro018.E.dialogueact939	2480.07	2480.5	E	PhD	b	-1	0	it's just a 
Bro018.C.dialogueact941	2483.66	2484.62	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and so if you but so that but that's 
Bro018.E.dialogueact942	2484.09	2486.44	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	if you yeah but so that but that's a fixed uh thing there's nothing that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact944	2486.66	2488.69	C	Professor	s^aa|s^m	-1	0	yeah i i think that's fixed thing but thing there's nothing that lets you 
Bro018.E.dialogueact943	2486.44	2487.54	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^g.%--	-1	0	yeah i i think that's thing there's nothing that lets you 
Bro018.C.dialogueact945	2488.69	2490.05	C	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	fixed thing but she she my point if you had 
Bro018.C.dialogueact946	2490.05	2496.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	if you had if you had ten filters then you would be strong away a lot to to lance and 
Bro018.E.dialogueact947	2495.66	2496.0	E	PhD	b	-1	0	to to lance and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact948	2496.99	2500.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and if you had if you had fifty filters should be throwaway hardly 
Bro018.E.dialogueact949	2501.08	2501.53	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact950	2502.15	2508.08	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	um i don't remember there being independent way of saying we're just going make them from here to here but i i use this analysis bandwidth or something 
Bro018.E.dialogueact951	2507.11	2508.97	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	them from here to here but i i use this analysis bandwidth or something 
Bro018.C.dialogueact952	2508.72	2509.64	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	but i i don't know it's actually bandwidth or something 
Bro018.C.dialogueact953	2509.64	2511.33	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	don't know it's actually been a while since i've yeah i went through the fee 
Bro018.E.dialogueact954	2510.91	2516.01	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	been a while since i've yeah i went through the fee calicoes and then looked at was calling the rust allied something like that and i didn't i couldn't 
Bro018.E.dialogueact955	2516.01	2519.66	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and i didn't i couldn't see any place where that kind of thing was done but 
Bro018.E.dialogueact956	2519.85	2522.69	E	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah see i was done but um i didn't quite understand everything that i saw so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact957	2522.65	2524.21	C	Professor	fg|s^no	-1	0	yeah see i don't know if he calc at all that i saw so 
Bro018.E.dialogueact958	2522.69	2522.91	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah see i that i saw so 
Bro018.E.dialogueact959	2524.37	2525.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	but it calls 
Bro018.C.dialogueact960	2525.38	2527.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but it calls roster with some options 
Bro018.C.dialogueact961	2527.37	2528.34	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro018.C.dialogueact963	2529.75	2530.46	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but i think in i 
Bro018.C.dialogueact964	2530.93	2531.53	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	think in i don't know i guess 
Bro018.C.dialogueact965	2531.53	2537.06	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	don't know i guess for some particular database you might find you could tune and and take that to get that little better but i think that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact966	2537.06	2541.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but i think that in general it's not at critical i mean there's 
Bro018.C.dialogueact967	2541.06	2541.74	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean there's 
Bro018.E.dialogueact968	2541.55	2541.87	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean there's 
Bro018.C.dialogueact969	2542.43	2545.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you can you can throw away shuffle hundred hertz or so and is just 
Bro018.C.dialogueact970	2545.48	2549.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so and is just that classification another 
Bro018.E.dialogueact971	2549.77	2553.53	E	PhD	qy^tc.%--	-1	0	another thing i was thinking about was um is there a 
Bro018.E.dialogueact972	2554.99	2563.54	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i was wondering if there's maybe um certain settings of the parameters when you can p. p. l. p. which would basically cause closet the output no capture him 
Bro018.E.dialogueact973	2565.02	2567.64	E	PhD	s	-1	0	that in effect what i could do is use our code but pretty snow 
Bro018.E.dialogueact974	2567.64	2568.77	E	PhD	s	-1	0	our code but pretty snow kept strum 
Bro018.E.dialogueact975	2569.67	2571.25	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and compare that directly too 
Bro018.C.dialogueact976	2572.16	2573.28	C	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	it's not precisely 
Bro018.C.dialogueact977	2573.87	2574.19	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact979	2574.31	2574.74	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro018.C.dialogueact981	2578.33	2592.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	what you can do is um you can definitely changed the the filter bank from being uh a uh trappers article integration to it at triangular one 
Bro018.E.dialogueact982	2593.19	2593.55	E	PhD	b	-1	0	which 
Bro018.C.dialogueact983	2594.05	2597.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	is what the typical no no caps true uh filter bank does 
Bro018.E.dialogueact984	2597.95	2598.4	E	PhD	b	-1	0	bank does some 
Bro018.C.dialogueact985	2598.94	2601.63	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	some people claim that they got some better performance during that to certainly 
Bro018.C.dialogueact986	2601.63	2604.01	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	during that to certainly like do usually but the fundamental 
Bro018.C.dialogueact987	2604.66	2606.14	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but the fundamental difference i mean there's other small there's 
Bro018.C.dialogueact988	2606.14	2607.69	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean there's other small differences there's a kid recruit that happens 
Bro018.E.dialogueact989	2606.88	2608.48	E	PhD	s^2^bu	-1	0	i mean there's other small differences there's a kid recruit that happens right 
Bro018.E.dialogueact990	2608.48	2608.71	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right 
Bro018.C.dialogueact991	2610.14	2610.54	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah but you 
Bro018.C.dialogueact992	2610.76	2613.12	C	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	yeah but you know as opposed to the law like any other case i mean to define melted 
Bro018.C.dialogueact993	2613.12	2627.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean to define melted the difference that we've seen any kind of difference from before which is actually an advantage for deal p. is uh i think it's that the the smoothing at the end is utter aggressive instead of being kept so it from justification 
Bro018.C.dialogueact994	2629.18	2631.74	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so um it's a little more nicer bust 
Bro018.E.dialogueact995	2631.93	2632.34	E	PhD	b	-1	0	bust 
Bro018.C.dialogueact996	2633.13	2640.2	C	Professor	s	-1	0	um and that's that's why when people start game databases that have little more noise and then like like uh uh broadcast news and so on it's like cambridge 
Bro018.C.dialogueact997	2640.2	2642.39	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it's like cambridge switched appeal p. i think 
Bro018.E.dialogueact998	2642.64	2643.01	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i think so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact999	2643.43	2644.51	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1000	2645.94	2650.42	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that's a difference that i don't think we put any way to get around since it was an 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1001	2650.42	2651.66	C	Professor	s	-1	0	since it was an advantage 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1003	2652.12	2653.62	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um uh but 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1002	2651.98	2652.51	E	PhD	b	-1	0	advantage um 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1004	2653.7	2664.78	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh but we did we did hear this comment from people at some point that and they got some better results as the triangular filters into that episode also that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1005	2664.78	2666.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	episode also that is an option 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1006	2667.48	2667.74	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1007	2668.25	2670.43	C	Professor	s	-1	0	thank 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1008	2670.86	2673.22	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	thank you probably doing the right thing to look for books first yeah i just it 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1010	2673.67	2674.28	C	Professor	s^no.%	-1	0	yeah i just it just seems like this 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1009	2673.61	2680.07	E	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah i just it just seems like this kind of behavior could be caused by you know it's some of the training data being messed up you know 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1011	2680.81	2681.1	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	you know you sort of getting most 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1012	2680.91	2683.65	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you know you sort of getting most of the way there but there's a 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1013	2684.16	2685.68	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so i started going through and looking one 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1014	2685.91	2697.09	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and looking one of the things that i did notice was that the um log likelihood coming out of the recognize or from the peel p. data were much lower much smaller than for 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1015	2697.27	2707.07	E	PhD	s	-1	0	than for the milk capsule stuff and that be average amount of pruning that was happening was there for a little bit higher for the p. features 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1016	2707.22	2707.75	C	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.E.dialogueact1017	2708.2	2715.16	E	PhD	s	-1	0	oh so except to use the same exact pruning threshold for both i was wondering if it could be that we're getting more pruning 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1018	2715.39	2715.96	C	Professor	s^bk^fe	-1	0	oh 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1019	2716.07	2721.47	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	he he he used the identical pruning specials even though this is the range of the the the like oh well that's 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1020	2719.01	2719.26	E	PhD	b	-1	0	even though this is the 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1021	2721.47	2724.66	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	like oh well that's that's it point right there yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1022	2721.62	2721.86	E	PhD	b	-1	0	like oh well that's 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1023	2722.71	2722.91	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that's 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1024	2724.66	2724.93	C	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	right there yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1025	2725.01	2725.31	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i would 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1027	2725.9	2733.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i would think that you might want to do something like uh you look at a few points to see where you are starting to get significant search errors that's right well what 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1026	2725.51	2725.88	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	i would 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1028	2732.0	2732.54	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	significant search errors 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1029	2733.43	2733.63	E	PhD	b	-1	0	right well what 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1030	2733.83	2739.04	E	PhD	s	-1	0	right well what i was going to do was i was going to take um a couple of the other and says that he had run through then 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1031	2739.56	2741.52	E	PhD	s	-1	0	then running through again but modify 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1032	2741.52	2745.78	E	PhD	s	-1	0	again but modify the purring threshold and see if it affects the score 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1033	2744.83	2745.04	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	affects the score 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1034	2746.72	2746.96	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1036	2747.33	2756.81	C	Professor	s^cs^rt	-1	0	i mean if if if that looks promising you could you know uh run overall tests that with uh with a few different uh pinning specials for both 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1035	2747.3	2747.53	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	i mean if 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1037	2755.17	2755.61	E	PhD	b	-1	0	uh pinning specials 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1039	2757.38	2763.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and presumably he's running it some turning threshold that's that's uh you know gets very few search errors but 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1038	2756.94	2757.14	E	PhD	b	-1	0	for both and presumably 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1040	2763.97	2765.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	few search errors but is is relatively fast right i mean yeah generally 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1041	2764.05	2764.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	is is relatively 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1042	2765.12	2769.42	E	PhD	fg|s^df	-1	0	fast right i mean yeah generally in these things you you turn back running really far so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1043	2765.69	2765.8	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	fast right i mean yeah generally 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1044	2769.42	2772.13	E	PhD	s	-1	0	far so i i didn't think it would be that big a deal because i was frequently 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1045	2772.13	2775.32	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but you may be in the wrong because i was frequently have it turn back so far that you know 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1046	2775.21	2778.09	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	but you may be in the wrong range for the p. o. p. features for some reason know yeah yeah india said 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1047	2776.31	2776.69	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	range for the p. o. p. yeah yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1048	2776.82	2777.03	E	PhD	b	-1	0	range for the p. o. p. features for some reason yeah yeah 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1049	2777.69	2777.87	E	PhD	b	-1	0	features for some reason 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1050	2778.48	2782.28	E	PhD	s	-1	0	india said that the run time of the recognize on tippy features is longer which sort of 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1051	2782.56	2784.91	E	PhD	s	-1	0	which sort of implies that the networks are bush here you 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1052	2785.05	2786.42	E	PhD	s	-1	0	know there's more things it's considering which goes 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1053	2786.8	2789.32	E	PhD	s	-1	0	which goes along with the fact that the matches aren't as good so 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1054	2789.9	2794.25	E	PhD	s	-1	0	good so uh you know it could be that were just burning 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1056	2795.55	2795.91	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro018.C.dialogueact1060	2800.12	2800.33	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	uh yeah so that's that's another 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1061	2800.33	2802.33	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh yeah so that's that's another possible thing that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1063	2803.01	2804.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	they should really shouldn't there's no particular reason

Bro018.B.dialogueact1089	2842.45	2846.95	B	Grad	s	+1	2	um do you have an down no i'm taking this um six seconds of speech 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1090	2847.13	2852.97	B	Grad	s	+1	1	um amusing to second at fifty analysis frames step i have second 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1091	2853.34	2854.47	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so the quarter things step and they 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1092	2854.47	2857.91	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	step and they i think that frame and four for the before i think so 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1093	2857.91	2858.16	B	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	the before i think so i think the current frame in 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1094	2858.16	2862.04	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i think the current frame in the four past frames and the for future frames in that that adds up to 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1095	2862.04	2864.32	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	in that that adds up to six seconds of speech i calculate 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1096	2864.85	2871.71	B	Grad	s	+1	1	i calculate um the spectrum i mean of the log magnitude spectrum over that and 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1097	2872.13	2877.18	B	Grad	s	+1	1	i use that to normalize sticks the current sensor frame i mean subtraction and and then i moved 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1098	2877.51	2880.44	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and and then i moved to next raymond i do it again 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1099	2881.2	2882.74	B	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	well actually i calculate all the means person i do 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1100	2882.74	2883.82	B	Grad	s	-1	0	all the means person i do subtraction 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1101	2884.39	2887.17	B	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	and um that i tried that with h. d. k. d. aurora a setup

Bro018.B.dialogueact1104	2893.73	2896.17	B	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	it helped um in a phony reverberations case um 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1105	2896.17	2906.91	B	Grad	s	+1	1	um where i just use a simulated impulse response um dear rate went from something like eighty just from some of eighteen percent to uh four percent 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1106	2907.75	2917.74	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and on meeting with recorded for mike digits make it i'm channel pass it went from um forty one percent error to eight percent or

Bro018.B.dialogueact1111	2927.68	2930.57	B	Grad	s	-1	0	only which i'm guessing is the reason why the baseline was so bad

Bro018.C.dialogueact1141	2992.49	2993.8	C	Professor	s^t1	-1	0	yes that was it's nice them 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1142	2994.26	2994.71	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	you're right yeah because 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1143	2994.71	2994.84	C	Professor	b	-1	0	you're right yeah because 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1144	2994.84	2997.95	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	you're right yeah because i was getting like one percent so still that's kind of ratio it 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1145	2997.95	3001.3	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	kind of ratio it was it was getting one percent or something on not near feel pleasant 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1146	3001.3	3001.84	C	Professor	qy^g^rt	-1	0	pleasant 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1147	3002.16	3002.47	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	uhhuh or 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1148	3002.47	3004.4	E	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah yeah i think was getting around one percent uhhuh or was it was around one 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1149	3003.49	3003.79	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah yeah i was it was around 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1150	3003.85	3007.28	C	Professor	fg|s^na	-1	0	yeah yeah i think was getting around one percent for the new have been so that close mike was it was around one 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1151	3004.62	3004.82	E	PhD	b	-1	0	think was getting around one percent one 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1152	3007.42	3007.66	B	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.B.dialogueact1154	3008.19	3008.48	B	Grad	b	-1	0	so it was like one to five 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1153	3008.18	3009.35	C	Professor	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	so it was like one to five so it's so it's kind 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1155	3009.35	3010.59	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's so it's kind of racial it's just 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1156	3010.59	3010.94	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	of racial it's just 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1157	3011.08	3011.25	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah it's a lot more training 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1158	3011.25	3012.25	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah it's a lot more training day 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1159	3013.97	3014.43	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1160	3015.57	3021.93	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so probably should be something we should try then is to just to see if is at some point just to take it to transform the data and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1161	3021.93	3025.91	C	Professor	s	-1	0	transform the data and then and then uh used uses for the surround system 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1162	3031.34	3033.12	B	Grad	qy^d.%-	-1	0	you mean you mean um so you're you have a system which 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1163	3032.78	3036.0	C	Professor	s	-1	0	um so you're you have a system which for owners another's relatively poor and and 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1164	3036.2	3036.55	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and and 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1165	3036.61	3039.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and and uh you have something like forty one percent error 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1166	3040.55	3044.34	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh and then you transform it dates by doing during this this work um 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1167	3044.97	3045.46	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1168	3045.81	3048.32	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so here's this other system which is a lot better distilled 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1169	3048.57	3049.96	C	Professor	s	-1	0	distilled it's kind of ratio something 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1170	3049.96	3053.67	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it's kind of ratio something like five percent there with it that just in mike in one percent 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1171	3053.67	3055.55	C	Professor	s	-1	0	in mike in one percent of the cross spike so 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1172	3055.05	3055.24	B	Grad	b	-1	0	spike so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1173	3056.05	3061.8	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	the question is how close to that one can you get if you transform the data using that system 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1174	3062.46	3067.45	B	Grad	h|s	-1	0	right so so i guess this is sri system a strain on a broadcast news or switchboard uh 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1176	3068.31	3068.62	B	Grad	qy^g^rt	-1	0	so it's you know 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1175	3068.07	3068.29	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so it's you know 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1177	3068.62	3069.67	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	so it's you know which one it is it's trained 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1178	3069.54	3071.45	E	PhD	s	-1	0	which one it is it's trained on a lot of different things um 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1179	3071.45	3071.97	E	PhD	h	-1	0	um 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1180	3072.11	3075.39	E	PhD	s	-1	0	it's trained on uh a lot of switchboard call home um 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1181	3075.75	3076.34	B	Grad	b	-1	0	um 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1182	3075.86	3078.04	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um a bunch of different sources some digits some 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1183	3078.04	3078.78	E	PhD	s	-1	0	some digits some 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1184	3078.88	3080.24	E	PhD	s	-1	0	what one some digits some digits training in there 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1185	3079.53	3079.85	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	digits training in there 
Bro018.A.dialogueact1187	3080.63	3081.47	A	Grad	b	-1	0	what one thing i'm wondering about is 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1186	3080.55	3086.97	B	Grad	s	-1	0	what one thing i'm wondering about is what this means subtraction method um we'll do if it's safe without it it's nice 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1188	3087.72	3093.1	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because i i because i i don't know what love my attitude sexual subtraction is going to do to additive noise yeah well it's 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1189	3093.51	3093.75	C	Professor	s^bk^rt	-1	0	yeah well it's 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1191	3094.1	3094.7	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	it's not exactly 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1190	3093.75	3095.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah well it's it's not exactly the right thing but 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1192	3095.91	3096.68	B	Grad	b	-1	0	the right thing but uh 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1193	3096.03	3099.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh but you were already seen that because there is that nice nicer 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1194	3100.8	3102.17	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that's yeah that's true 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1196	3103.04	3103.53	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	good point 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1195	3102.64	3102.92	C	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1197	3104.39	3105.48	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.B.dialogueact1198	3107.52	3112.62	B	Grad	s^bk^rt|s^bu	-1	0	okay so it's ten it's it's it's it's reasonable to expect it would be helpful if we used it with the sri system 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1199	3112.62	3112.76	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	system 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1200	3113.44	3113.62	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i mean as 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1201	3113.62	3114.76	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i mean as helpful i mean 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1202	3114.76	3114.97	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	helpful i mean 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1203	3115.03	3115.74	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that's a question 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1204	3116.16	3122.41	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah we were often asked us when we work with a system that that isn't isn't serve industry industry standard great 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1205	3122.2	3122.48	B	Grad	b	-1	0	great 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1206	3123.1	3126.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and we see some reduction they're using some clever method then you know we'll 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1207	3126.17	3129.39	C	Professor	qy	-1	0	then you know we'll work on a on a good system so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1208	3129.39	3131.38	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1209	3132.2	3133.84	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	you know this other ones is pretty good system i think 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1210	3133.84	3141.15	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	is pretty good system i think you know one one percent where eight on digits is uh digit strings is not uh you know stellar but but given 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1211	3141.15	3145.64	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but but given this is real digits as opposed to uh sort of laboratory 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1212	3143.11	3143.28	B	Grad	b	-1	0	digits as opposed 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1213	3146.27	3146.57	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	and i wasn't trained 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1214	3146.32	3147.97	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i wasn't and i wasn't trained on this task 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1215	3147.79	3149.1	C	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	i wasn't paying in this task actually one percent sort on this task 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1216	3149.1	3151.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	actually one percent sort of sort of re sport ranch people say 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1218	3151.42	3151.79	B	Grad	b	-1	0	ranch people say 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1217	3151.35	3153.39	C	Professor	s	-1	0	ranch people say i could i could imagine getting that 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1219	3154.16	3158.72	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	and uh so the the four or five percent or something is is is quite poor 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1220	3158.76	3159.42	B	Grad	b	-1	0	quite poor uh you know if 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1221	3159.5	3165.94	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh you know if you're doing any uh sixteen digit uh credit card number you basically get around almost all the time so 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1223	3166.07	3166.34	B	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1222	3165.94	3168.69	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	almost all the time so so uh um significant 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1224	3168.83	3171.21	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	um significant reduction there for that would be great 
Bro018.B.dialogueact1225	3171.52	3172.01	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1226	3171.65	3173.29	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1227	3173.29	3173.46	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1228	3173.64	3173.94	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1229	3174.87	3175.11	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1230	3175.79	3176.03	C	Professor	b	-1	0	sounds good

Bro018.C.dialogueact1232	3177.09	3177.29	C	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1233	3178.6	3181.38	C	Professor	s^bk|s^t	-1	0	right um i actually have to run so 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1234	3181.71	3183.56	C	Professor	s^t	-1	0	so i don't think i can do the digits but 
Bro018.C.dialogueact1235	3183.56	3186.48	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	digits but i guess i'll leave my microphone on 
Bro018.E.dialogueact1236	3187.5	3187.98	E	PhD	h|s^aa	-1	0	uh yeah
