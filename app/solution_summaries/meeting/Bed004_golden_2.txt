One of ICSIs research groups at Berkley met to discuss progress on the current project a tourism based dialogue system.
The small group had visual aids which assisted their discussion.
They have conducted the first test with a human playing the part of both automated and human operator which provided valuable feedback.
They discussed the development of the belief network that will be behind the system.
They touched on representation ontology interaction and the desire for a generalised system.
They also talked about upcoming meetings with people from different groups and how they could benefit.
The girl who played the system in the first test should be hired to do it permanently.
When developing the BayesNet the group have to be mind full of a potential combinatoric explosion.
The first Wizard test has been completed.
Me003 has been working on developing the BayesNet.
