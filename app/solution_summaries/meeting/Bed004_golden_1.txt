In this meeting of the Berkeley Even Deeper Understanding group speaker mn015 presented the results of an experiment of the dialogue system Wizard created for the tourist domain.
The experiment consisted of leading a subject to believe she were talking to a computer then having the computer break down and be replaced with a human.
The group then discussed improvements to the programs user interface personnel issues regarding further data collection as well as conceptual and architectural issues regarding the Wizard.
The introduction needs to be shortened and streamlined.
A graduate student will be hired to oversee further testing.
In a forthcoming meeting the refinement of the test data and the technicalities of the testing process will be discussed.
Linguistic expertise and world knowledge is needed to improve the system.
Instructions to the test subject were not clear enough as she did not follow them precisely.
It might be difficult to find subjects that can cope with the reading task.
What kind of information should be used by the system.
How should this information be derived from the user query the dialogue context and the ontology.
How should it be encoded.
The system can only deal with a limited amount of input.
Can cognitive linguistics be used to get powerful generalisations.
How can a parser make use of spatial adverbs.
The subject of the demo was convinced that she was talking to a system and behaved accordingly.
Therefore the concept of the wizard seems feasible.
