In the first part of the Berkeley Meeting Recorder group meeting members discussed the results and implications of a spoken digit recognition experiment using lapel microphones and the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit HTK.
It is reported that while the lapel microphones deliver good results the HTK is outperformed by the SRI toolkit.
Comparisons to other digit corpora such as TI are also made.
The second part of the discussion focused on alignment of multiple speaker channels specifically the problems of overlapping speech and back channelling.
Speaker adaptation was identified as an important issue is recognition as well as alignment.
The performance difference between HTK and SRI must be due to the lack of phone loop and means and variance adaptation for HTK.
For realistic experimental results cheap microphones should be used rather than expensive ones.
Speaker fe016 is planning to submit a paper on alignment to Eurospeech.
Lapel microphones are sensitive to noises such as clothes rustling.
Recognition of digits recorded with close microphones is significantly more difficult than that of studio recorded TI digits.
The amount of close microphone data is too small to train a reliable Hidden Markov Model.
Alignment quality is detrimentally affected by background speech.
Lapel microphone performed well on a spoken digit recognition task.
It is suggested that their robustness due to the fact that they are omni directional.
It is discovered that the optimal pruning parameters are different for recognition and for alignment.
