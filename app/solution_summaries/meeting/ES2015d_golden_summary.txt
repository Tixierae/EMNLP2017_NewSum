The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. The designers give the prototype presentation , showing their simple design that is based on a mango. They point out the company logo and LED , and demonstrate how the device is palm-held and thumb-acessible. They also discuss the numerical , volume , channel , and power buttons as well as the color scheme.
