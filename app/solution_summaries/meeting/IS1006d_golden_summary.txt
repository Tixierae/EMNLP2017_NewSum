This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype. It has on-off and volume buttons , an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours , which largely replaces the use of push buttons , and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD. It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface , which also serves as mechanism for locating the device. It was designed to be powered by a single battery. The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion. The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness , technology , robustness , usefulness , size , colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype , although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive. Finally , the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team , they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership. *NA* After the team realised the prototype was over budget , they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo. When it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the LCD or the speech recognition , they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget. The gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case (even if they cover sensors) did not meet everyone's approval. Although , the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends , the result did not satisfy the program manager. The prototype was more than 40% over budget. The team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype.
