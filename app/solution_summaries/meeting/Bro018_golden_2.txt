The ICSI Meeting Recorder Group met once more to discuss their recent progress in various projects as well as discuss some of the issues that have arisen in the last week.
There has been further work on voiced unvoiced detection along with spectral subtraction.
The group discussed one members attendance at a conference and another groups code which is proving hard to follow.
In trying to understand France Telecoms code there does not appear to be a reason for a particular constant value.
Speaker fn002 reported on her work with mn007 who was absent attending a conference.
They have been working on voiced unvoiced detection and have tried two different configuration of MLP although results have not been improved greatly.
She has also begun looking at France Telecoms recogniser code.
Speaker me006 has been coming up with tests for his work using acoustic events.
Speaker me018 is investigating differences in another system and feels it maybe down to bugs.
Speaker me026 has made real progress on his spectral subtraction work with an implementation and early results.
